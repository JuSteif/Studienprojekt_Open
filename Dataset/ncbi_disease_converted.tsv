PMID:0	NA	NA	NA	NA	Identification of APC2 , a homologue of the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor .
PMID:1	NA	NA	NA	NA	The adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumour - suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK - 3beta ) , axin / conductin and betacatenin .
PMID:2	NA	NA	NA	NA	Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin .
PMID:3	NA	NA	NA	NA	In colon carcinoma cells , loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus , where it binds to and activates the Tcf - 4 transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) .
PMID:4	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here , we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues .
PMID:5	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mammalian APC2 , which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure , was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains , both of which are required for binding to conductin .
PMID:6	NA	NA	NA	NA	Like APC , APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin - Tcf complexes , as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC - / - colon carcinoma cells .
PMID:7	NA	NA	NA	NA	Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13 .
PMID:8	NA	NA	NA	NA	3 .
PMID:9	NA	NA	NA	NA	APC and APC2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and cancer .
PMID:10	NA	NA	NA	NA	A common MSH2 mutation in English and North American HNPCC families : origin , phenotypic expression , and sex specific differences in colorectal cancer .
PMID:11	NA	NA	NA	NA	The frequency , origin , and phenotypic expression of a germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified in seven kindreds with hereditary non - polyposis cancer syndrome ( HNPCC ) was investigated .
PMID:12	NA	NA	NA	NA	The mutation ( A - - > T at nt943 + 3 ) disrupts the 3 splice site of exon 5 leading to the deletion of this exon from MSH2 mRNA and represents the only frequent MSH2 mutation so far reported .
PMID:13	NA	NA	NA	NA	Although this mutation was initially detected in four of 33 colorectal cancer families analysed from eastern England , more extensive analysis has reduced the frequency to four of 52 ( 8 % ) English HNPCC kindreds analysed .
PMID:14	NA	NA	NA	NA	In contrast , the MSH2 mutation was identified in 10 of 20 ( 50 % ) separately identified colorectal families from Newfoundland .
PMID:15	NA	NA	NA	NA	To investigate the origin of this mutation in colorectal cancer families from England ( n = 4 ) , Newfoundland ( n = 10 ) , and the United States ( n = 3 ) , haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked to MSH2 was performed .
PMID:16	NA	NA	NA	NA	Within the English and US families there was little evidence for a recent common origin of the MSH2 splice site mutation in most families .
PMID:17	NA	NA	NA	NA	In contrast , a common haplotype was identified at the two flanking markers ( CA5 and D2S288 ) in eight of the Newfoundland families .
PMID:18	NA	NA	NA	NA	These findings suggested a founder effect within Newfoundland similar to that reported by others for two MLH1 mutations in Finnish HNPCC families .
PMID:19	NA	NA	NA	NA	We calculated age related risks of all , colorectal , endometrial , and ovarian cancers in nt943 + 3 A - - > T MSH2 mutation carriers ( n = 76 ) for all patients and for men and women separately .
PMID:20	NA	NA	NA	NA	For both sexes combined , the penetrances at age 60 years for all cancers and for colorectal cancer were 0 .
PMID:21	NA	NA	NA	NA	86 and 0 .
PMID:22	NA	NA	NA	NA	57 , respectively .
PMID:23	NA	NA	NA	NA	The risk of colorectal cancer was significantly higher ( p < 0 . 01 ) in males than females ( 0 . 63 v 0 . 30 and 0 . 84 v 0 . 44 at ages 50 and 60 years , respectively ) .
PMID:24	NA	NA	NA	NA	For females there was a high risk of endometrial cancer ( 0 . 5 at age 60 years ) and premenopausal ovarian cancer ( 0 . 2 at 50 years ) .
PMID:25	NA	NA	NA	NA	These intersex differences in colorectal cancer risks have implications for screening programmes and for attempts to identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers .
PMID:26	NA	NA	NA	NA	Age of onset in Huntington disease : sex specific influence of apolipoprotein E genotype and normal CAG repeat length .
PMID:27	NA	NA	NA	NA	Age of onset ( AO ) of Huntington disease ( HD ) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene .
PMID:28	NA	NA	NA	NA	Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype , in turn , is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease , rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too .
PMID:29	NA	NA	NA	NA	We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length .
PMID:30	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information .
PMID:31	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients , we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females .
PMID:32	NA	NA	NA	NA	Such a sex difference in AO was not apparent for any of the other APOE genotypes .
PMID:33	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration in HD may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon AO .
PMID:34	NA	NA	NA	NA	Familial deficiency of the seventh component of complement associated with recurrent bacteremic infections due to Neisseria .
PMID:35	NA	NA	NA	NA	The serum of a 29 - year old woman with a recent episode of disseminated gonococcal infection and a history of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child was found to lack serum hemolytic complement activity .
PMID:36	NA	NA	NA	NA	The seventh component of complement ( C7 ) was not detected by functional or immunochemical assays , whereas other components were normal by hemolytic and immunochemical assessment .
PMID:37	NA	NA	NA	NA	Her fresh serum lacked complement - mediated bactericidal activity against Neisseria gonorrhoeae , but the addition of fresh normal serum or purified C7 restored bactericidal activity as well as hemolytic activity .
PMID:38	NA	NA	NA	NA	The absence of functional C7 activity could not be accounted for on the basis of an inhibitor .
PMID:39	NA	NA	NA	NA	Opsonization and generation of chemotactic activity functioned normally .
PMID:40	NA	NA	NA	NA	Complete absence of C7 was also found in one sibling who had the clinical syndrome of meningococcal meningitis and arthritis as a child and in this siblings clinically well eight - year - old son .
PMID:41	NA	NA	NA	NA	HLA histocompatibility typing of the family members did not demonstrate evidence for genetic linkage of C7 deficiency with the major histocompatibility loci .
PMID:42	NA	NA	NA	NA	This report represents the first cases of C7 deficiency associated with infectious complications and suggests that bactericidal activity may be important in host defense against bacteremic neisseria infections .
PMID:43	NA	NA	NA	NA	Increased incidence of cancer in patients with cartilage - hair hypoplasia .
PMID:44	NA	NA	NA	NA	OBJECTIVE Previous reports have suggested an increased risk of cancer among patients with cartilage - hair hypoplasia ( CHH ) .
PMID:45	NA	NA	NA	NA	This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first - degree relatives .
PMID:46	NA	NA	NA	NA	STUDY DESIGN One hundred twenty - two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986 .
PMID:47	NA	NA	NA	NA	Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center .
PMID:48	NA	NA	NA	NA	This cohort underwent follow - up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995 .
PMID:49	NA	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH ( standardized incidence ratio 6 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval 2 . 3 to 16 ) , which was mainly attributable to non - Hodgkins lymphoma ( standardized incidence ratio 90 , 95 % confidence interval 18 to 264 ) .
PMID:50	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition , a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen ( standardized incidence ratio 35 , 95 % confidence interval 7 . 2 to 102 ) .
PMID:51	NA	NA	NA	NA	The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population .
PMID:52	NA	NA	NA	NA	CONCLUSIONS This study confirms an increased risk of cancer , especially non - Hodgkins lymphoma , probably attributable to defective immunity , among patients with CHH .
PMID:53	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genotype and phenotype in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency .
PMID:54	NA	NA	NA	NA	Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine - uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype .
PMID:55	NA	NA	NA	NA	In order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for DPD deficiency , we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of DPD .
PMID:56	NA	NA	NA	NA	In this group of patients , 7 different mutations have been identified , including 2 deletions [ 295 - 298delTCAT , 1897delC ] , 1 splice - site mutation [ IVS14 + 1G > A ) ] and 4 missense mutations ( 85T > C , 703C > T , 2658G > A , 2983G > T ) .
PMID:57	NA	NA	NA	NA	Analysis of the prevalence of the various mutations among DPD patients has shown that the G - - > A point mutation in the invariant splice donor site is by far the most common ( 52 % ) , whereas the other six mutations are less frequently observed .
PMID:58	NA	NA	NA	NA	A large phenotypic variability has been observed , with convulsive disorders , motor retardation and mental retardation being the most abundant manifestations .
PMID:59	NA	NA	NA	NA	A clear correlation between the genotype and phenotype has not been established .
PMID:60	NA	NA	NA	NA	An altered beta - alanine , uracil and thymine homeostasis might underlie the various clinical abnormalities encountered in patients with DPD deficiency .
PMID:61	NA	NA	NA	NA	Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 ( FHF2 ) : gene structure , expression and mapping to the Borjeson - Forssman - Lehmann syndrome region in Xq26 delineated by a duplication breakpoint in a BFLS - like patient .
PMID:62	NA	NA	NA	NA	Borjeson - Forssman - Lehmann syndrome ( BFLS ) is a syndromal X - linked mental retardation , which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human X chromosome .
PMID:63	NA	NA	NA	NA	We have identified a male patient with BFLS - like features and a duplication , 46 , Y , dup ( X ) ( q26q28 ) , inherited from his phenotypically normal mother .
PMID:64	NA	NA	NA	NA	Fluorescence in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from Xq26 localised the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400 - kb interval in the Xq26 .
PMID:65	NA	NA	NA	NA	3 region between DXS155 and DXS294 / DXS730 .
PMID:66	NA	NA	NA	NA	Database searches and analysis of available genomic DNA sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor gene , FHF2 , within the duplication breakpoint interval .
PMID:67	NA	NA	NA	NA	The gene structure of FHF2 was determined and two new exons were identified , including a new 5 end exon , 1B .
PMID:68	NA	NA	NA	NA	FHF2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in Xq26 .
PMID:69	NA	NA	NA	NA	3 and is composed of at least seven exons .
PMID:70	NA	NA	NA	NA	It shows tissue - specific alternative splicing and alternative transcription starts .
PMID:71	NA	NA	NA	NA	Northern blot hybridisation showed highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle .
PMID:72	NA	NA	NA	NA	The FHF2 gene localisation and tissue - specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial cases of the BFLS syndrome and other syndromal and non - specific forms of X - linked mental retardation mapping to the region .
PMID:73	NA	NA	NA	NA	Germline E - cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer .
PMID:74	NA	NA	NA	NA	Inherited mutations in the E - cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer .
PMID:75	NA	NA	NA	NA	Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non - Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations .
PMID:76	NA	NA	NA	NA	Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences .
PMID:77	NA	NA	NA	NA	Each family contained ( i ) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric cancer .
PMID:78	NA	NA	NA	NA	Novel germline CDH1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25 % ) .
PMID:79	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E - cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain .
PMID:80	NA	NA	NA	NA	In one family there was evidence of non - penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric cancer , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years .
PMID:81	NA	NA	NA	NA	We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non - Maori populations .
PMID:82	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations .
PMID:83	NA	NA	NA	NA	Loss of E - cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer .
PMID:84	NA	NA	NA	NA	Thus , CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .
PMID:85	NA	NA	NA	NA	A zinc finger truncation of murine WT1 results in the characteristic urogenital abnormalities of Denys - Drash syndrome .
PMID:86	NA	NA	NA	NA	The Wilms tumor - suppressor gene , WT1 , plays a key role in urogenital development , and WT1 dysfunction is implicated in both neoplastic ( Wilms tumor , mesothelioma , leukemias , and breast cancer ) and nonneoplastic ( glomerulosclerosis ) disease .
PMID:87	NA	NA	NA	NA	The analysis of diseases linked specifically with WT1 mutations , such as Denys - Drash syndrome ( DDS ) , can provide valuable insight concerning the role of WT1 in development and disease .
PMID:88	NA	NA	NA	NA	DDS is a rare childhood disease characterized by a nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis , XY pseudohermaphroditism , and / or Wilms tumor ( WT ) .
PMID:89	NA	NA	NA	NA	DDS patients are constitutionally heterozygous for exonic point mutations in WT1 , which include mutations predicted to truncate the protein within the C - terminal zinc finger ( ZF ) region .
PMID:90	NA	NA	NA	NA	We report that heterozygosity for a targeted murine Wt1 allele , Wt1 ( tmT396 ) , which truncates ZF3 at codon 396 , induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic of DDS in adult heterozygous and chimeric mice .
PMID:91	NA	NA	NA	NA	Male genital defects also were evident and there was a single case of Wilms tumor in which the transcript of the nontargeted allele showed an exon 9 skipping event , implying a causal link between Wt1 dysfunction and Wilms tumorigenesis in mice .
PMID:92	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , the mutant WT1 ( tmT396 ) protein accounted for only 5 % of WT1 in both heterozygous embryonic stem cells and the WT .
PMID:93	NA	NA	NA	NA	This has implications regarding the mechanism by which the mutant allele exerts its effect .
PMID:94	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mechanism of increased iron absorption in murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis : increased duodenal expression of the iron transporter DMT1 .
PMID:95	NA	NA	NA	NA	Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption .
PMID:96	NA	NA	NA	NA	We recently reported that HFE , the protein defective in HH , was physically associated with the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in HFE attenuate the uptake of transferrin - bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells , leading to up - regulation of transporters for dietary iron .
PMID:97	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here , we tested the hypothesis that HFE - / - mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter ( DMT1 ) .
PMID:98	NA	NA	NA	NA	By 4 weeks of age , the HFE - / - mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with HFE + / + littermates , with elevated transferrin saturations ( 68 . 4 % vs . 49 . 8 % ) and elevated liver iron concentrations ( 985 micrograms vs . 381 micrograms ) .
PMID:99	NA	NA	NA	NA	By using Northern blot analyses , we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of DMT1 transcripts one containing an iron responsive element ( IRE ) , called DMT1 ( IRE ) , and one containing no IRE , called DMT1 ( non - IRE ) .
PMID:100	NA	NA	NA	NA	The positive control for DMT1 up - regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA .
PMID:101	NA	NA	NA	NA	HFE - / - mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA ( average 7 . 7 - fold ) , despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content .
PMID:102	NA	NA	NA	NA	Duodenal expression of DMT1 ( non - IRE ) was not increased , nor was hepatic expression of DMT1 increased .
PMID:103	NA	NA	NA	NA	These data support the model for HH in which HFE mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron , with resultant stabilization of DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA , up - regulation of DMT1 , and increased absorption of dietary iron .
PMID:104	NA	NA	NA	NA	Neurophysiologic follow - up of long - term dietary treatment in adult - onset adrenoleukodystrophy .
PMID:105	NA	NA	NA	NA	OBJECTIVE To monitor the effects of dietary treatment in adult - onset adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) by means of somatosensory evoked potentials ( SEPs ) and motor evoked potentials ( MEPs ) .
PMID:106	NA	NA	NA	NA	BACKGROUND SEPs and MEPs have proved useful in revealing signs of progressively severe , central dying - back axonopathy in early stages of adult - onset ALD .
PMID:107	NA	NA	NA	NA	METHODS Eight patients with adult - onset ALD underwent clinical examination , brain and spine MRI , and SEP and MEP studies before and after 3 years of Lorenzos oil dietary therapy .
PMID:108	NA	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS Before treatment , brain MRI was normal in five patients .
PMID:109	NA	NA	NA	NA	Three of these patients had pure spinal SEP abnormalities and in the remaining two patients SEPs showed signs of involvement of both the spinal and cerebral somatosensory tracts .
PMID:110	NA	NA	NA	NA	After treatment , the three patients with pure spinal abnormalities showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening , whereas the two patients with a more advanced stage of disease ( exhibited by SEPs ) showed substantially unchanged clinical and neurophysiologic features .
PMID:111	NA	NA	NA	NA	The patients with abnormal brain MRI at the onset of treatment showed clinical and neurophysiologic worsening .
PMID:112	NA	NA	NA	NA	CONCLUSIONS Lorenzos oil therapy had no effect on patients with evidence of inflammatory brain lesions .
PMID:113	NA	NA	NA	NA	Moreover , in patients without clear signs of inflammatory damage , this treatment does not modify significantly the natural course of the disease .
PMID:114	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , because effective treatments should begin before the onset of severe neurologic symptoms , SEPs and MEPs should be considered to evaluate the effectiveness of other experimental treatments in the patient with a negative brain MRI .
PMID:115	NA	NA	NA	NA	GCH1 mutation in a patient with adult - onset oromandibular dystonia .
PMID:116	NA	NA	NA	NA	The authors report a mutation in exon 5 of GCH1 in a patient with adult - onset oromandibular dystonia and no obvious family history of dystonia .
PMID:117	NA	NA	NA	NA	The patient responded positively to treatment with L - dopa .
PMID:118	NA	NA	NA	NA	These findings demonstrate that GCH1 mutations must be considered even in patients with dystonic symptoms not typical of dopa - responsive dystonia .
PMID:119	NA	NA	NA	NA	Germline mutations of the APC gene in Korean familial adenomatous polyposis patients .
PMID:120	NA	NA	NA	NA	We extensively analyzed genomic DNA and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) from 62 unrelated Korean patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) for identification of germline adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene mutations .
PMID:121	NA	NA	NA	NA	We adopted both single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and a method of analysis involving the reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) followed by a protein truncation test ( PTT ) .
PMID:122	NA	NA	NA	NA	DNA sequencing confirmed all alterations represented by aberrant bands .
PMID:123	NA	NA	NA	NA	Germline mutations were identified in 38 patients ( 61 % ) .
PMID:124	NA	NA	NA	NA	Nineteen of the detected mutations were presumed to be novel , thus emphasizing the heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum in Korean FAP patients .
PMID:125	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the initial 48 patients , SSCP analysis was followed by PTT for those patients for whom no detectable mutations were found by SSCP .
PMID:126	NA	NA	NA	NA	Using this combined approach , we identified germline APC gene mutations in 29 of the 48 FAP patients ( 60 % ) , including 6 patients in whom SSCP analysis failed to distinguish the mutant allele .
PMID:127	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the 14 later patients , we identified truncating mutations in 9 patients ( 64 % ) using PTT only .
PMID:128	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our results confirm that the mutation detection rate with PTT was superior to that with SSCP , and suggest that PTT would be a more practical screening method to detect germline mutations of the APC gene in FAP patients .
PMID:129	NA	NA	NA	NA	Molecular epidemiology of C9 deficiency heterozygotes with an Arg95Stop mutation of the C9 gene in Japan .
PMID:130	NA	NA	NA	NA	Deficiency of the ninth component of human complement ( C9 ) is the most common complement deficiency in Japan , with an incidence of approximately one homozygote in 1000 , but is very rare in other countries .
PMID:131	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genetic analyses of Japanese C9 deficiency have shown that a C - to - T transition leading to TGA stop codon for Arg95 in exon 4 of the C9 gene ( Arg95Stop ) is common in Japanese C9 deficiency .
PMID:132	NA	NA	NA	NA	To determine the prevalence of heterozygous carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation in a Japanese population , we collected DNA samples from 300 individuals in two of the four main islands of Japan .
PMID:133	NA	NA	NA	NA	Heterozygote detection was performed with an allele - specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) system designed to detect exclusively only one of the normal and mutant alleles , followed by confirmation with PCR / single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) analysis and direct sequencing .
PMID:134	NA	NA	NA	NA	Twenty individuals were heterozygous for the Arg95Stop mutation .
PMID:135	NA	NA	NA	NA	None was homozygous .
PMID:136	NA	NA	NA	NA	The prevalence of carriers of the Arg95Stop mutation was 6 .
PMID:137	NA	NA	NA	NA	7 % ( 20 / 300 ) .
PMID:138	NA	NA	NA	NA	An estimated frequency ( 0 . 12 % ) of complete C9 deficiency due to homozygous Arg95Stop mutation was consistent with frequencies determined by serological studies
PMID:139	NA	NA	NA	NA	The hereditary hemochromatosis protein , HFE , specifically regulates transferrin - mediated iron uptake in HeLa cells .

PMID:170	NA	NA	NA	NA	HFE does not remain at the cell surface , but traffics with TfR to Tf - positive internal compartments ( Gross et al . , 1998 ) .
PMID:171	NA	NA	NA	NA	Using a HeLa cell line in which the expression of HFE is controlled by tetracycline , we show that the expression of HFE reduces 55Fe uptake from Tf by 33 % but does not affect the endocytic or exocytic rates of TfR cycling .
PMID:172	NA	NA	NA	NA	Therefore , HFE appears to reduce cellular acquisition of iron from Tf within endocytic compartments .
PMID:173	NA	NA	NA	NA	HFE specifically reduces iron uptake from Tf , as non - Tf - mediated iron uptake from Fe - nitrilotriacetic acid is not altered .
PMID:174	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results explain the decreased ferritin levels seen in our HeLa cell system and demonstrate the specific control of HFE over the Tf - mediated pathway of iron uptake .
PMID:175	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results also have implications for the understanding of cellular iron homeostasis in organs such as the liver , pancreas , heart , and spleen that are iron loaded in hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE .
PMID:176	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutation and haplotype studies of familial Mediterranean fever reveal new ancestral relationships and evidence for a high carrier frequency with reduced penetrance in the Ashkenazi Jewish population .
PMID:177	NA	NA	NA	NA	Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessive disorder characterized by episodes of fever with serositis or synovitis .
PMID:178	NA	NA	NA	NA	The FMF gene ( MEFV ) was cloned recently , and four missense mutations were identified .
PMID:179	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here we present data from non - Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new , more ethnically diverse panel .
PMID:180	NA	NA	NA	NA	Among 90 symptomatic mutation - positive individuals , 11 mutations accounted for 79 % of carrier chromosomes .
PMID:181	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of the two mutations that are novel , one alters the same residue ( 680 ) as a previously known mutation , and the other ( P369S ) is located in exon 3 .
PMID:182	NA	NA	NA	NA	Consistent with another recent report , the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes , but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non - Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations .
PMID:183	NA	NA	NA	NA	Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples , the MEFV carrier frequency was 21 % , with E148Q the most common mutation .
PMID:184	NA	NA	NA	NA	Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews , especially for E148Q , P369S , and K695R .
PMID:185	NA	NA	NA	NA	Nevertheless , E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF .
PMID:186	NA	NA	NA	NA	The presence of three frequent MEFV mutations in multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region .
PMID:187	NA	NA	NA	NA	Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome with defective Fas : genotype influences penetrance .
PMID:188	NA	NA	NA	NA	Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) is a disorder of lymphocyte homeostasis and immunological tolerance .
PMID:189	NA	NA	NA	NA	Most patients have a heterozygous mutation in the APT1 gene , which encodes Fas ( CD95 , APO - 1 ) , mediator of an apoptotic pathway crucial to lymphocyte homeostasis .
PMID:190	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of 17 unique APT1 mutations in unrelated ALPS probands , 12 ( 71 % ) occurred in exons 7 - 9 , which encode the intracellular portion of Fas .
PMID:191	NA	NA	NA	NA	In vitro , activated lymphocytes from all 17 patients showed apoptotic defects when exposed to an anti - Fas agonist monoclonal antibody .
PMID:192	NA	NA	NA	NA	Similar defects were found in a Fas - negative cell line transfected with cDNAs bearing each of the mutations .
PMID:193	NA	NA	NA	NA	In cotransfection experiments , Fas constructs with either intra - or extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition of apoptosis mediated by wild - type Fas .
PMID:194	NA	NA	NA	NA	Two missense Fas variants , not restricted to patients with ALPS , were identified .
PMID:195	NA	NA	NA	NA	Variant A ( - 1 ) T at the Fas signal - sequence cleavage site , which mediates apoptosis less well than wild - type Fas and is partially inhibitory , was present in 13 % of African American alleles .
PMID:196	NA	NA	NA	NA	Among the ALPS - associated Fas mutants , dominant inhibition of apoptosis was much more pronounced in mutants affecting the intracellular , versus extracellular , portion of the Fas receptor .
PMID:197	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations causing disruption of the intracellular Fas death domain also showed a higher penetrance of ALPS phenotype features in mutation - bearing relatives .
PMID:198	NA	NA	NA	NA	Significant ALPS - related morbidity occurred in 44 % of relatives with intracellular mutations , versus 0 % of relatives with extracellular mutations .
PMID:199	NA	NA	NA	NA	Thus , the location of mutations within APT1 strongly influences the development and the severity of ALPS .
PMID:200	NA	NA	NA	NA	Multicentric origin of hemochromatosis gene ( HFE ) mutations .
PMID:201	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genetic hemochromatosis ( GH ) is believed to be a disease restricted to those of European ancestry .
PMID:202	NA	NA	NA	NA	In northwestern Europe , > 80 % of GH patients are homozygous for one mutation , the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 ( C282Y ) in the unprocessed protein .
PMID:203	NA	NA	NA	NA	In a proportion of GH patients , two mutations are present , C282Y and H63D .
PMID:204	NA	NA	NA	NA	The clinical significance of this second mutation is such that it appears to predispose 1 % - 2 % of compound heterozygotes to expression of the disease .
PMID:205	NA	NA	NA	NA	The distribution of the two mutations differ , C282Y being limited to those of northwestern European ancestry and H63D being found at allele frequencies > 5 % , in Europe , in countries bordering the Mediterranean , in the Middle East , and in the Indian subcontinent .
PMID:206	NA	NA	NA	NA	The C282Y mutation occurs on a haplotype that extends < / = 6 Mb , suggesting that this mutation has arisen during the past 2 , 000 years .
PMID:207	NA	NA	NA	NA	The H63D mutation is older and does not occur on such a large extended haplotype , the haplotype in this case extending < / = 700 kb .
PMID:208	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here we report the finding of the H63D and C282Y mutations on new haplotypes .
PMID:209	NA	NA	NA	NA	In Sri Lanka we have found H63D on three new haplotypes and have found C282Y on one new haplotype , demonstrating that these mutations have arisen independently on this island .
PMID:210	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results suggest that the HFE gene has been the subject of selection pressure .
PMID:211	NA	NA	NA	NA	These selection pressures could be due to infectious diseases , environmental conditions , or other genetic disorders such as anemia .
PMID:212	NA	NA	NA	NA	A retrospective anonymous pilot study in screening newborns for HFE mutations in Scandinavian populations .
PMID:213	NA	NA	NA	NA	We have retrospectively analyzed 837 random anonymized dried blood spot ( DBS ) samples from neonatal screening programs in Scandinavia for mutations in HFE , the candidate gene for hemochromatosis .

PMID:224	NA	NA	NA	NA	Identification of the mutation in the alkaptonuria mouse model .
PMID:225	NA	NA	NA	NA	Alkaptonuria ( aku ) , an inborn error of metabolism caused by the loss of homogentisate 1 , 2 - dioxygenase ( HGD ) , has been described in a mouse model created by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis but the mutation in these mice has not previously been identified .
PMID:226	NA	NA	NA	NA	We used RT - PCR to amplify the Hgd cDNA from Hgd ( aku ) / Hgd ( aku ) mice .
PMID:227	NA	NA	NA	NA	Two products shorter than the wild - type product were amplified .
PMID:228	NA	NA	NA	NA	Restriction mapping and DNA sequencing were then used to identify the Hgd ( aku ) mouse mutation , found to be a single base change in a splice donor consensus sequence , causing exon skipping and frame - shifted products .
PMID:229	NA	NA	NA	NA	This base change allowed us to create a non - radioactive genotyping assay for this allele .
PMID:230	NA	NA	NA	NA	Non - syndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct is caused by PDS mutations .
PMID:231	NA	NA	NA	NA	Enlarged vestibular aqueduct ( EVA ) , known as the most common form of inner ear abnormality , has recently been of particular genetic interest because this anomaly is inherited in a recessive manner .
PMID:232	NA	NA	NA	NA	The locus for non - syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA has been mapped to the same chromosomal region , 7q31 , as the Pendred syndrome locus .
PMID:233	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the present study , seven mutations in the PDS gene ( PDS ) , the gene responsible for Pendred syndrome , have been found in families of non - syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with EVA .
PMID:234	NA	NA	NA	NA	One family is homozygous , three families are compound heterozygotes , and two families are heterozygous but with no other mutation detected .
PMID:235	NA	NA	NA	NA	The present results provide evidence that mutations in PDS cause both syndromic and non - syndromic hearing loss . .
PMID:236	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutational analysis and genotype - phenotype correlation of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy .
PMID:237	NA	NA	NA	NA	BACKGROUND X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is an inherited disease characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction , occasionally associated with adrenal insufficiency .
PMID:238	NA	NA	NA	NA	The classic form of ALD usually has onset in childhood ( childhood cerebral ALD ) , with rapid neurologic deterioration leading to a vegetative state .
PMID:239	NA	NA	NA	NA	Adult - onset cerebral ALD also presents with rapidly progressive neurologic dysfunction .
PMID:240	NA	NA	NA	NA	Milder phenotypes such as adrenomyeloneuropathy and Addison disease only also have been recognized .
PMID:241	NA	NA	NA	NA	Despite discovery of the causative gene , a molecular basis for the diverse clinical presentations remains to be elucidated .
PMID:242	NA	NA	NA	NA	OBJECTIVES To conduct mutational analyses in 29 Japanese patients with ALD from 29 unrelated families , to obtain knowledge of the spectrum of mutations in this gene , and to study genotype - phenotype correlations in Japanese patients .
PMID:243	NA	NA	NA	NA	METHODS The 29 patients comprised 13 patients with childhood cerebral ALD , 11 patients with adult - onset cerebral ALD , and 5 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy .
PMID:244	NA	NA	NA	NA	We conducted detailed mutational analyses of 29 unrelated Japanese patients with ALD by genomic Southern blot analysis and direct nucleotide sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction products derived from total RNA that was extracted from cultured skin fibroblasts , lymphoblastoid cells , or peripheral blood leukocytes .
PMID:245	NA	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS Three patients with adult - onset cerebral ALD were identified as having large genomic rearrangements .
PMID:246	NA	NA	NA	NA	The remaining 26 patients were identified as having 21 independent mutations , including 12 novel mutations resulting in small nucleotide alterations in the ALD gene .
PMID:247	NA	NA	NA	NA	Eighteen ( 69 % ) of 26 mutations were missense mutations .
PMID:248	NA	NA	NA	NA	Most missense mutations involved amino acids conserved in homologous gene products , including PMP70 , mALDRP , and Pxa1p .
PMID:249	NA	NA	NA	NA	The AG dinucleotide deletion at position 1081 - 1082 , which has been reported previously to be the most common mutation in white patients ( 12 % - 17 % ) , was also identified as the most common mutation in Japanese patients ( 12 % ) .
PMID:250	NA	NA	NA	NA	All phenotypes were associated with mutations resulting in protein truncation or subtle amino acid changes .
PMID:251	NA	NA	NA	NA	There were no differences in phenotypic expressions between missense mutations involving conserved amino acids and those involving nonconserved amino acids .
PMID:252	NA	NA	NA	NA	CONCLUSIONS There are no obvious correlations between the phenotypes of patients with ALD and their genotypes , suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors modify the phenotypic expressions of ALD . .
PMID:253	NA	NA	NA	NA	A common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta - catenin .
PMID:254	NA	NA	NA	NA	WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs .
PMID:255	NA	NA	NA	NA	In response to this stimulus , cytoplasmic beta - catenin ( encoded by CTNNB1 ) is stabilized , enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF / TCF family .
PMID:256	NA	NA	NA	NA	One of the target genes for beta - catenin / TCF encodes c - MYC , explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer , particularly in the colon .
PMID:257	NA	NA	NA	NA	Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) , a protein required for ubiquitin - mediated degradation of beta - catenin , but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta - catenin - stabilizing mutations .
PMID:258	NA	NA	NA	NA	Recently , we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta - catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas .
PMID:259	NA	NA	NA	NA	Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair - follicle morphogenesis , we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta - catenin - stabilizing mutations .
PMID:260	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here , we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour .
PMID:261	NA	NA	NA	NA	We found nuclear LEF - 1 in the dividing tumour cells , providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells .
PMID:262	NA	NA	NA	NA	At least 75 % of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino - terminal segment , normally involved in phosphorylation - dependent , ubiquitin - mediated degradation of the protein .
PMID:263	NA	NA	NA	NA	This percentage of CTNNB1 mutations is greater than in all other human tumours examined thus far , and directly implicates beta - catenin / LEF misregulation as the major cause of hair matrix cell tumorigenesis in humans . .
PMID:264	NA	NA	NA	NA	The Pendred syndrome gene encodes a chloride - iodide transport protein .
PMID:265	NA	NA	NA	NA	Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre .
PMID:266	NA	NA	NA	NA	This disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing Pendred syndrome ( PDS ) was subsequently identified by positional cloning .
PMID:267	NA	NA	NA	NA	PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin .
PMID:268	NA	NA	NA	NA	Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate - anion transporter ( encoded by Sat - 1 ; 29 % amino acid sequence identity ) , the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter ( encoded by DTD ; 32 % ) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma ( encoded by DRA ; 45 % ) .
PMID:269	NA	NA	NA	NA	On the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate - transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain , pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter .
PMID:270	NA	NA	NA	NA	We were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of PDS cRNA or in Sf9 cells following infection with PDS - recombinant baculovirus .
PMID:271	NA	NA	NA	NA	The rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems .
PMID:272	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our results demonstrate that pendrin functions as a transporter of chloride and iodide , but not sulfate , and may provide insight into thyroid physiology and the pathophysiology of Pendred syndrome . .
PMID:273	NA	NA	NA	NA	HFE mutations analysis in 711 hemochromatosis probands : evidence for S65C implication in mild form of hemochromatosis .
PMID:274	NA	NA	NA	NA	Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is a common autosomal recessive genetic disorder of iron metabolism .
PMID:275	NA	NA	NA	NA	The HFE candidate gene encoding an HLA class I - like protein involved in HH was identified in 1996 .
PMID:276	NA	NA	NA	NA	Two missense mutations have been described C282Y , accounting for 80 % to 90 % of HH chromosomes , and H63D , which is associated with a milder form of the disease representing 40 % to 70 % of non - C282Y HH chromosomes .
PMID:277	NA	NA	NA	NA	We report here on the analysis of C282Y , H63D , and the 193A - - > T substitution leading to the S65C missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls .
PMID:278	NA	NA	NA	NA	The results confirm that the C282Y substitution was the main mutation involved in hemochromatosis , accounting for 85 % of carrier chromosomes , whereas the H63D substitution represented 39 % of the HH chromosomes that did not carry the C282Y mutation .
PMID:279	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition , our screening showed that the S65C substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation .
PMID:280	NA	NA	NA	NA	This substitution accounted for 7 .
PMID:281	NA	NA	NA	NA	8 % of HH chromosomes that were neither C282Y nor H63D .
PMID:282	NA	NA	NA	NA	This enrichment of S65C among HH chromosomes suggests that the S65C substitution is associated with the mild form of hemochromatosis .
PMID:283	NA	NA	NA	NA	Germline BRCA1 alterations in a population - based series of ovarian cancer cases .
PMID:284	NA	NA	NA	NA	The objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population .
PMID:285	NA	NA	NA	NA	To achieve this , we determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a population - based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases .
PMID:286	NA	NA	NA	NA	This is the first population - based ovarian cancer study reporting BRCA1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region .
PMID:287	NA	NA	NA	NA	One hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for BRCA1 alterations using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing .
PMID:288	NA	NA	NA	NA	Two truncating mutations , 962del4 and 3600del11 , were identified .
PMID:289	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer .
PMID:290	NA	NA	NA	NA	Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified , some of which were associated with a family history of cancer .
PMID:291	NA	NA	NA	NA	The frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele - specific amplification .
PMID:292	NA	NA	NA	NA	The rare form of the Q356R polymorphism was significantly ( P = 0 . 03 ) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer , suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk .
PMID:293	NA	NA	NA	NA	In summary , our data suggest a role for some uncharacterized variants and rare forms of polymorphisms in determining ovarian cancer risk , and highlight the necessity to screen for missense alterations as well as truncating mutations in this population .
PMID:294	NA	NA	NA	NA	Adrenoleukodystrophy - related protein can compensate functionally for adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency ( X - ALD ) : implications for therapy .
PMID:295	NA	NA	NA	NA	Inherited defects in the peroxisomal ATP - binding cassette ( ABC ) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein ( ALDP ) lead to the lethal peroxisomal disorder X - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( X - ALD ) , for which no efficient treatment has been established so far .
PMID:296	NA	NA	NA	NA	Three other peroxisomal ABC transporters currently are known adrenoleukodystrophy - related protein ( ALDRP ) , 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein ( PMP70 ) and PMP70 - related protein .
PMID:297	NA	NA	NA	NA	By using transient and stable overexpression of human cDNAs encoding ALDP and its closest relative ALDRP , we could restore the impaired peroxisomal beta - oxidation in fibroblasts of X - ALD patients .
PMID:298	NA	NA	NA	NA	The pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids could also be prevented by overexpression of ALDRP in immortalized X - ALD cells .
PMID:299	NA	NA	NA	NA	Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the functional replacement of ALDP by ALDRP was not due to stabilization of the mutated ALDP itself .
PMID:300	NA	NA	NA	NA	Moreover , we were able to restore the peroxisomal beta - oxidation defect in the liver of ALDP - deficient mice by stimulation of ALDRP and PMP70 gene expression through a dietary treatment with the peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate .
PMID:301	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results suggest that a correction of the biochemical defect in X - ALD could be possible by drug - induced overexpression or ectopic expression of ALDRP . .
PMID:302	NA	NA	NA	NA	Centrosome amplification and a defective G2 - M cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability in BRCA1 exon 11 isoform - deficient cells .
PMID:303	NA	NA	NA	NA	Germline mutations of the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers .
PMID:304	NA	NA	NA	NA	To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1 - related tumorigenesis , we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the Brca1 gene .
PMID:305	NA	NA	NA	NA	We show that the mutant cells maintain an intact G1 - S cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly .
PMID:306	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , a defective G2 - M checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive chromosomal abnormalities .
PMID:307	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutant fibroblasts contain multiple , functional centrosomes , which lead to unequal chromosome segregation , abnormal nuclear division , and aneuploidy .
PMID:308	NA	NA	NA	NA	These data uncover an essential role of BRCA1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the G2 - M checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of BRCA1 in tumorigenesis . .
PMID:309	NA	NA	NA	NA	Defective CD95 / APO - 1 / Fas signal complex formation in the human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome , type Ia .
PMID:310	NA	NA	NA	NA	Heterozygous mutations in the CD95 ( APO - 1 / Fas ) receptor occur in most individuals with autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome ( ALPS ) and dominantly interfere with apoptosis by an unknown mechanism .
PMID:311	NA	NA	NA	NA	We show that local or global alterations in the structure of the cytoplasmic death domain from nine independent ALPS CD95 death - domain mutations result in a failure to bind the FADD / MORT1 signaling protein .
PMID:312	NA	NA	NA	NA	Despite heterozygosity for the abnormal allele , lymphocytes from ALPS patients showed markedly decreased FADD association and a loss of caspase recruitment and activation after CD95 crosslinking .
PMID:313	NA	NA	NA	NA	These data suggest that intracytoplasmic CD95 mutations in ALPS impair apoptosis chiefly by disrupting death - domain interactions with the signaling protein FADD / MORT1 . .
PMID:314	NA	NA	NA	NA	Analysis of alkaptonuria ( AKU ) mutations and polymorphisms reveals that the CCC sequence motif is a mutational hot spot in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) .
PMID:315	NA	NA	NA	NA	We recently showed that alkaptonuria ( AKU ) is caused by loss - of - function mutations in the homogentisate 1 , 2 dioxygenase gene ( HGO ) .
PMID:316	NA	NA	NA	NA	Herein we describe haplotype and mutational analyses of HGO in seven new AKU pedigrees .
PMID:317	NA	NA	NA	NA	These analyses identified two novel single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( INV4 + 31A - - > G and INV11 + 18A - - > G ) and six novel AKU mutations ( INV1 - 1G - - > A , W60G , Y62C , A122D , P230T , and D291E ) , which further illustrates the remarkable allelic heterogeneity found in AKU .
PMID:318	NA	NA	NA	NA	Reexamination of all 29 mutations and polymorphisms thus far described in HGO shows that these nucleotide changes are not randomly distributed ; the CCC sequence motif and its inverted complement , GGG , are preferentially mutated .
PMID:319	NA	NA	NA	NA	These analyses also demonstrated that the nucleotide substitutions in HGO do not involve CpG dinucleotides , which illustrates important differences between HGO and other genes for the occurrence of mutation at specific short - sequence motifs .
PMID:320	NA	NA	NA	NA	Because the CCC sequence motifs comprise a significant proportion ( 34 . 5 % ) of all mutated bases that have been observed in HGO , we conclude that the CCC triplet is a mutational hot spot in HGO .
PMID:321	NA	NA	NA	NA	Fabry disease : identification of novel alpha - galactosidase A mutations and molecular carrier detection by use of fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatches .
PMID:322	NA	NA	NA	NA	Fabry disease ( FD ) ( angiokeratoma corporis diffusum ) is an X - linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha - galactosidase A gene ( GLA ) .
PMID:323	NA	NA	NA	NA	The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha - galactosyl moieties .
PMID:324	NA	NA	NA	NA	Clinically , affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma , severe acroparesthesia , renal failure , and vasculopathy of the heart and brain .
PMID:325	NA	NA	NA	NA	While demonstration of alpha - galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males , enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive , due to random X - chromosomal inactivation , underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling .
PMID:326	NA	NA	NA	NA	By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence - based detection systems , we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha - Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD .
PMID:327	NA	NA	NA	NA	The mutational spectrum included five missense mutations ( C202W , C223G , N224D , R301Q , and Q327K ) and one splice - site mutation [ IVS3 G ( - 1 ) - - > C ] .
PMID:328	NA	NA	NA	NA	Studies at the mRNA level showed that the latter led to altered pre - mRNA splicing with consequent alteration of the mRNA translational reading frame and generation of a premature termination codon of translation .
PMID:329	NA	NA	NA	NA	By use of this strategy , carrier status was accurately assessed in all seven at - risk females tested , whereas enzymatic dosages failed to diagnose or exclude heterozygosity . .
PMID:330	NA	NA	NA	NA	Prenatal diagnosis by FISH in a family with Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease caused by duplication of PLP gene .
PMID:331	NA	NA	NA	NA	A diagnosis of Pelizaeus - Merzbacher disease ( MIM 312080 ) was made in a young boy .
PMID:332	NA	NA	NA	NA	No mutation in the coding region of the proteolipid protein ( PLP ) gene had been found .
PMID:333	NA	NA	NA	NA	The boys maternal aunt came for prenatal diagnosis when 16 + weeks pregnant and carrying a male fetus .
PMID:334	NA	NA	NA	NA	Samples were tested for duplication of the PLP gene , by interphase FISH , in lymphocyte preparations from the proband , his aunt and an amniotic fluid cell preparation from the fetus .
PMID:335	NA	NA	NA	NA	The proband was found to carry the duplication , thus confirming the diagnosis of Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease , but neither the aunt nor the fetus carried a duplication . .

PMID:337	NA	NA	NA	NA	Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis .
PMID:338	NA	NA	NA	NA	Patients with familial APC ( FAP ) carry germ - line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life .
PMID:339	NA	NA	NA	NA	The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation ( genotype - phenotype correlation ) .
PMID:340	NA	NA	NA	NA	Together with the fact that both germ - line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene , this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants .
PMID:341	NA	NA	NA	NA	Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta - catenin - / Tcf - mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells .
PMID:342	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here , we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis .
PMID:343	NA	NA	NA	NA	Wild - type APC activity in beta - catenin - / Tcf - mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309 .
PMID:344	NA	NA	NA	NA	In contrast , mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis ( codon 386 or 1465 ) interfered only weakly with wild - type APC activity .
PMID:345	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype - phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be , in part , driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region . .

PMID:347	NA	NA	NA	NA	Germ - line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor - suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer .
PMID:348	NA	NA	NA	NA	BRCA1 contains a carboxyl - terminal domain ( BRCT ) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity .
PMID:349	NA	NA	NA	NA	In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1 , we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain .
PMID:350	NA	NA	NA	NA	Purified BRCT polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library by Far Western analysis .
PMID:351	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here we report that BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb - binding proteins , RbAp46 and RbAp48 , as well as with Rb .
PMID:352	NA	NA	NA	NA	Moreover , the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 .
PMID:353	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results demonstrate that BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex , and therefore may explain the involvement of BRCA1 in multiple processes such as transcription , DNA repair , and recombination . .

PMID:355	NA	NA	NA	NA	By routine screening of sera , a subject was discovered who showed a sub - total deficiency of C6 and C7 .
PMID:356	NA	NA	NA	NA	No clinical disease was associated with this deficiency which was transmitted through the subjects family as a single genetic characteristic , the C6 deficiency being associated with a silent allele at the structural locus .
PMID:357	NA	NA	NA	NA	The propositus was found to have low quantities of an abnormal C6 which was both antigenically deficient and smaller in size than normal C6 ( 110 , 000 daltons compared with 140 , 000 daltons ) and small quantities of apparently normal C7 .
PMID:358	NA	NA	NA	NA	It is concluded that the most likely explanation for this defect is that the subject has a structural mutation in his C6 gene which produces hyopsynthesis not only of C6 but also of the closely linked gene for C7 .
PMID:359	NA	NA	NA	NA	These findings suggest the possibility that C6 and C7 may function as a single genetic unit and that the primary transcript copied from the genome includes information for both proteins . .
PMID:360	NA	NA	NA	NA	Changes at P183 of emerin weaken its protein - protein interactions resulting in X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy .
PMID:361	NA	NA	NA	NA	Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is an X - linked recessive muscular dystrophy characterized by early contractures of the elbows , Achilles tendons and spine , slowly progressive muscle wasting and weakness , and cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac conduction defects .
PMID:362	NA	NA	NA	NA	The emerin gene has been mapped to Xq28 and encodes a 34 - kDa serine - rich protein , emerin , which has been localized to the nuclear envelope in a wide variety of tissues , including skeletal and cardiac muscle .
PMID:363	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations spanning the emerin gene have been identified in patients with EDMD .
PMID:364	NA	NA	NA	NA	We present here the effect , on emerin protein expression , of two missense mutations identified in unrelated EDMD patients .
PMID:365	NA	NA	NA	NA	These alterations predict the replacement of a proline residue at position 183 with either a histidine or a threonine .
PMID:366	NA	NA	NA	NA	Biochemical analysis has demonstrated that the mobility and expression levels of the mutant forms of emerin are indistinguishable from that of wild - type emerin , but that they have weakened interactions with nuclear lamina components .
PMID:367	NA	NA	NA	NA	In comparison with the usual EDMD phenotype , patients with P183 missense mutations have a later age at onset of first symptoms , elbow contractures , ankle contractures , upper limb weakness and lower limb weakness , but there is no difference for the age at onset of cardiac involvement .
PMID:368	NA	NA	NA	NA	This is the first report of protein studies on patients with missense mutations resulting in the clinical features of EDMD .
PMID:369	NA	NA	NA	NA	These studies demonstrate the importance of proline 183 for the proper structure / function of emerin . .
PMID:370	NA	NA	NA	NA	Microdeletions at chromosome bands 1q32 - q41 as a cause of Van der Woude syndrome .
PMID:371	NA	NA	NA	NA	Van der Woude syndrome ( VWS ) is an autosomal dominant disorder comprising cleft lip and / or cleft palate and lip pits .

PMID:373	NA	NA	NA	NA	Along with cleft lip / palate and lip pits , affected relatives exhibit developmental delays , suggesting that the function of a gene nearby may also be disrupted .
PMID:374	NA	NA	NA	NA	To further localize the VWS gene we searched for other deletions that cause VWS .
PMID:375	NA	NA	NA	NA	An allele loss assay was performed using a novel highly polymorphic marker , D1S3753 .
PMID:376	NA	NA	NA	NA	From a panel of 37 unrelated individuals , we detected an allele loss in one family , indicating the presence of a deletion .

PMID:382	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion ( 30 / 62 [ 48 % ] ) of a new series of mutations in the ATM gene in patients with ataxia - telangiectasia ( AT ) that were detected by the protein - truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic DNA .
PMID:383	NA	NA	NA	NA	Fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical AG splice - acceptor site or GT splice - donor site .
PMID:384	NA	NA	NA	NA	A higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites , including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons , mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved AG and GT in the consensus splice sites , and creation of splice - acceptor or splice - donor sites in either introns or exons .
PMID:385	NA	NA	NA	NA	These splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences , including exon skipping and , to a lesser degree , intron retention , activation of cryptic splice sites , or creation of new splice sites .
PMID:386	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition , 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cDNA of the exons in which the mutations occurred .
PMID:387	NA	NA	NA	NA	No ATM protein was detected by western blotting in any AT cell line in which splicing mutations were identified .
PMID:388	NA	NA	NA	NA	Several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic DNA were also observed , suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in ATM cDNA when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations . .

PMID:405	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of 44 patients , nine ( 20 % ) had facial angiofibromas , tumours primarily occurring in association with tuberous sclerosis .
PMID:406	NA	NA	NA	NA	Oedemic buccal mucosa ( leucoedema ) and gingival overgrowths were more frequent in AGU patients than in controls ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
PMID:407	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of 16 oral mucosal lesions studied histologically , 15 represented fibroepithelial or epithelial hyperplasias and were reactive in nature .
PMID:408	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cytoplasmic vacuolisation was evident in four .
PMID:409	NA	NA	NA	NA	Immunohistochemically , expression of AGA in AGU patients mucosal lesions did not differ from that seen in corresponding lesions of normal subjects .
PMID:410	NA	NA	NA	NA	Thus , the high frequency of mucosal overgrowth in AGU patients does not appear to be directly associated with lysosomal storage or with alterations in the level of AGA expression .
PMID:411	NA	NA	NA	NA	Characterization of a germline mosaicism in families with Lowe syndrome , and identification of seven novel mutations in the OCRL1 gene .
PMID:412	NA	NA	NA	NA	The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) is an X - linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes , nervous system , and kidneys .

PMID:417	NA	NA	NA	NA	A missense mutation , R483G , was located in the highly conserved PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 5 - phosphatase domain .
PMID:418	NA	NA	NA	NA	Finally , one frameshift mutation , 2799delC , modifies the C - terminal part of OCRL1 , with an extension of six amino acids .
PMID:419	NA	NA	NA	NA	Altogether , 70 % of missense mutations are located in exon 15 , and 52 % of all mutations cluster in exons 11 - 15 .

PMID:423	NA	NA	NA	NA	Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) is a recessively inherited disorder that is common in patients of Armenian ancestry .
PMID:424	NA	NA	NA	NA	To date , its diagnosis , which can be made only retrospectively , is one of exclusion , based entirely on nonspecific clinical signs that result from serosal inflammation and that may lead to unnecessary surgery .
PMID:425	NA	NA	NA	NA	Renal amyloidosis , prevented by colchicine , is the most severe complication of FMF , a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene .
PMID:426	NA	NA	NA	NA	To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV - gene analysis , we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic - linkage analysis .
PMID:427	NA	NA	NA	NA	Eight mutations , one of which ( R408Q ) is new , were found to account for 93 % of the 163 independent FMF alleles , with both FMF alleles identified in 89 % of the patients .

PMID:429	NA	NA	NA	NA	The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis , compared with other genotypes ( P = . 0002 and P = . 006 , respectively ) .
PMID:430	NA	NA	NA	NA	The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF - including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families .
PMID:431	NA	NA	NA	NA	Noninvasive test for fragile X syndrome , using hair root analysis .
PMID:432	NA	NA	NA	NA	Identification of the FMR1 gene and the repeat - amplification mechanism causing fragile X syndrome led to development of reliable DNA - based diagnostic methods , including Southern blot hybridization and PCR .
PMID:433	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both methods are performed on DNA isolated from peripheral blood cells and measure the repeat size in FMR1 .
PMID:434	NA	NA	NA	NA	Using an immunocytochemical technique on blood smears , we recently developed a novel test for identification of patients with fragile X syndrome .
PMID:435	NA	NA	NA	NA	"This method , also called "" antibody test , "" uses monoclonal antibodies against the FMR1 gene product ( FMRP ) and is based on absence of FMRP in patients cells ."
PMID:436	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here we describe a new diagnostic test to identify male patients with fragile X syndrome , on the basis of lack of FMRP in their hair roots .
PMID:437	NA	NA	NA	NA	Expression of FMRP in hair roots was studied by use of an FMRP - specific antibody test , and the percentage of FMRP - expressing hair roots in controls and in male fragile X patients was determined .
PMID:438	NA	NA	NA	NA	Control individuals showed clear expression of FMRP in nearly every hair root , whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression of FMRP in almost all their hair roots .
PMID:439	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mentally retarded female patients with a full mutation showed FMRP expression in only some of their hair roots ( < 55 % ) , and no overlap with normal female controls was observed .
PMID:440	NA	NA	NA	NA	The advantages of this test are ( 1 ) plucking of hair follicles does no appreciable harm to the mentally retarded patient , ( 2 ) hairs can be sent in a simple envelope to a diagnostic center , and ( 3 ) the result of the test is available within 5 h of plucking .

PMID:445	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the present report we analyze 40 ( 12 original and 28 newly identified ) Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer ( HPC ) that , on the basis of 40 markers spanning a 25 - cM interval within 1q24 - 25 , have evidence of linkage .
PMID:446	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the complete set of families , a maximum two - point LOD score of 1 .

PMID:448	NA	NA	NA	NA	64 at D1S202 ( P = . 05 ) .
PMID:449	NA	NA	NA	NA	The evidence of linkage to this region originated almost exclusively from the subset of 12 early - onset ( age < 65 years ) families , which yielded a maximum LOD score of 2 .
PMID:450	NA	NA	NA	NA	38 at D1S413 ( straight theta = 0 ) and an NPL Z score of 1 .
PMID:451	NA	NA	NA	NA	95 at D1S422 ( P = . 03 ) .
PMID:452	NA	NA	NA	NA	Estimates from heterogeneity tests suggest that , within Sweden , as many as 50 % of early - onset families had evidence of linkage to the HPC1 region .

PMID:457	NA	NA	NA	NA	beta - Glucuronidase mRNA was normal in affected cat testis by Northern blot analysis .
PMID:458	NA	NA	NA	NA	Normal feline beta - glucuronidase cDNA was cloned and characterized , and amplified from affected cat fibroblasts by reverse transcription coupled polymerase chain reaction .
PMID:459	NA	NA	NA	NA	There was a G - to - A transition in the affected cat cDNA that predicted an E351K substitution , destroyed a BssSI site , and eliminated GUSB enzymatic activity in expression studies .
PMID:460	NA	NA	NA	NA	Multiple species comparison and the crystal structure of human beta - glucuronidase indicated that E351 is a highly conserved residue most likely essential in maintenance of the enzymes conformation .
PMID:461	NA	NA	NA	NA	BssSI digestion of polymerase chain reaction products amplified from genomic DNA indicated that affected cats were homozygous and cats with half - normal beta - glucuronidase activity were heterozygous for the missense mutation .

PMID:464	NA	NA	NA	NA	The chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors .
PMID:465	NA	NA	NA	NA	Three congenital anomaly disorders , cat - eye syndrome , der ( ) syndrome and velo - cardio - facial syndrome / DiGeorge syndrome ( VCFS / DGS ) are associated with tetrasomy , trisomy or monosomy , respectively , for part of chromosome 22q11 .
PMID:466	NA	NA	NA	NA	VCFS / DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements .
PMID:467	NA	NA	NA	NA	In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements , the deletion end - points in a large number of VCFS / DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis .
PMID:468	NA	NA	NA	NA	Most VCFS / DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion , some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1 .
PMID:469	NA	NA	NA	NA	5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations .
PMID:470	NA	NA	NA	NA	The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements .
PMID:471	NA	NA	NA	NA	To investigate this hypothesis , we developed hamster - human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS / DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats , termed LCR22s .
PMID:472	NA	NA	NA	NA	To support this idea further , we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS / DGS patients .
PMID:473	NA	NA	NA	NA	We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events , thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders .
PMID:474	NA	NA	NA	NA	We identified five additional copies of the LCR22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease .
PMID:475	NA	NA	NA	NA	Functional consequences of mutations in the early growth response 2 gene ( EGR2 ) correlate with severity of human myelinopathies .
PMID:476	NA	NA	NA	NA	The early growth response 2 gene ( EGR2 ) is a Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination .
PMID:477	NA	NA	NA	NA	This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 ( Egr2 ) knockout mice , which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation .
PMID:478	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot - Marie - Tooth type 1 , Dejerine - Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy .
PMID:479	NA	NA	NA	NA	Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA - binding domain .
PMID:480	NA	NA	NA	NA	The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain ( R1 ) that binds the NAB transcriptional co - repressors .
PMID:481	NA	NA	NA	NA	A combination of DNA - binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations .
PMID:482	NA	NA	NA	NA	The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity .
PMID:483	NA	NA	NA	NA	The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co - repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity .
PMID:484	NA	NA	NA	NA	These data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns . .
PMID:485	NA	NA	NA	NA	Autosomal recessive familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus with continued secretion of mutant weakly active vasopressin .
PMID:486	NA	NA	NA	NA	Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by post - natal development of arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) deficiency due to mutations in the AVP gene .
PMID:487	NA	NA	NA	NA	All published mutations affect the signal peptide or the neurophysin - II carrier protein and are presumed to interfere with processing of the preprohormone , leading to neuronal damage .
PMID:488	NA	NA	NA	NA	We studied an unusual Palestinian family consisting of asymptomatic first cousin parents and three children affected with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus , suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance .
PMID:489	NA	NA	NA	NA	All three affected children were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for a single novel mutation ( C301 - > T ) in exon 1 , replacing Pro7 of mature AVP with Leu ( Leu - AVP ) .
PMID:490	NA	NA	NA	NA	Leu - AVP was a weak agonist with approximately 30 - fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor .
PMID:491	NA	NA	NA	NA	Measured by radioimmunoassay with a synthetic Leu - AVP standard , serum Leu - AVP levels were elevated in all three children and further increased during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal .
PMID:492	NA	NA	NA	NA	The youngest child ( 2 years old ) was only mildly affected but had Leu - AVP levels similar to her severely affected 8 - year - old brother , suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young children . .
PMID:493	NA	NA	NA	NA	X inactivation and somatic cell selection rescue female mice carrying a Piga - null mutation .
PMID:494	NA	NA	NA	NA	A somatic mutation in the X linked PIGA gene is responsible for the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins on blood cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria .
PMID:495	NA	NA	NA	NA	No inherited form of GPI - anchor deficiency has been described .
PMID:496	NA	NA	NA	NA	Because conventional Piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice , we used the Cre / loxP system .
PMID:497	NA	NA	NA	NA	We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2 .
PMID:498	NA	NA	NA	NA	After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa - cre strain , the floxed allele undergoes Cre - mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development .
PMID:499	NA	NA	NA	NA	Because of X chromosome inactivation , female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI - linked proteins .
PMID:500	NA	NA	NA	NA	Analysis of mosaic mice showed that in heart , lung , kidney , brain , and liver , mainly wild - type Piga is active , suggesting that these tissues require GPI - linked proteins .
PMID:501	NA	NA	NA	NA	The salient exceptions were spleen , thymus , and red blood cells , which had almost equal numbers of cells expressing the wild - type or the recombined allele , implying that GPI - linked proteins are not essential for the derivation of these tissues .
PMID:502	NA	NA	NA	NA	PIGA ( - ) cells had no growth advantage , suggesting that other factors are needed for their clonal dominance in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . .
PMID:503	NA	NA	NA	NA	The C282Y mutation causing hereditary hemochromatosis does not produce a null allele .
PMID:504	NA	NA	NA	NA	Targeted mutagenesis was used to produce two mutations in the murine hemochromatosis gene ( Hfe ) locus .
PMID:505	NA	NA	NA	NA	The first mutation deletes a large portion of the coding sequence , generating a null allele .
PMID:506	NA	NA	NA	NA	The second mutation introduces a missense mutation ( C282Y ) into the Hfe locus , but otherwise leaves the gene intact .
PMID:507	NA	NA	NA	NA	This mutation is identical to the disease - causing mutation in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis .
PMID:508	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mice carrying each of the two mutations were bred and analyzed .
PMID:509	NA	NA	NA	NA	Homozygosity for either mutation results in postnatal iron loading .
PMID:510	NA	NA	NA	NA	The effects of the null mutation are more severe than the effects of the C282Y mutation .
PMID:511	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mice heterozygous for either mutation accumulate more iron than normal controls .
PMID:512	NA	NA	NA	NA	Interestingly , although liver iron stores are greatly increased , splenic iron is decreased .
PMID:513	NA	NA	NA	NA	We conclude that the C282Y mutation does not result in a null allele . .

PMID:516	NA	NA	NA	NA	Most emerin mutations result in absence of the protein .
PMID:517	NA	NA	NA	NA	In this study three mutations ( a missense mutation Pro183Thr and two in - frame deletions removing residues 95 - 99 and 236 - 241 , respectively ) were unusual in being associated with expression of mutant protein .
PMID:518	NA	NA	NA	NA	The phenotype in these families was compared in detail with the clinical features in cases with typical null mutations .
PMID:519	NA	NA	NA	NA	For the in - frame deletions there were no significant differences .
PMID:520	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the family with the missense mutation the phenotype was milder .
PMID:521	NA	NA	NA	NA	Age at onset was later for first symptoms and for development of ankle contractures and muscle weakness .
PMID:522	NA	NA	NA	NA	These findings have diagnostic implications as well as pointing to functionally important regions of the emerin protein . .

PMID:524	NA	NA	NA	NA	X - linked Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is a relatively rare benign neuromuscular disorder which can vary remarkably in onset , course and severity .
PMID:525	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the present study , a TCTAC deletion spanning the nucleotides 631 - 635 of the emerin gene caused an unusually severe disease phenotype including loss of ambulation and severe muscle wasting in two affected brothers .
PMID:526	NA	NA	NA	NA	The same mutation has been reported previously in an unrelated family showing a significantly milder phenotype .
PMID:527	NA	NA	NA	NA	The interfamilial heterogeneity in distribution and in severity of the features in the two families point to environmental or genetic modification as the cause of clinical variability in Emery - Dreifuss muscular dystrophy . .

PMID:530	NA	NA	NA	NA	We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer .
PMID:531	NA	NA	NA	NA	METHODS We examined genomic DNA from 83 ( for BRCA1 185delAG ) or 82 ( for BRCA2 6174delT ) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients , most of whom were treated at a relatively young age , for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population .
PMID:532	NA	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS Our study should have been able to detect a 4 - 5 - fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 .
PMID:533	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , only one ( 1 . 15 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 - 3 . 6 % ) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele , and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation ( 2 . 4 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0 - 6 . 2 % ) .
PMID:534	NA	NA	NA	NA	CONCLUSIONS The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence ( about 1 % ) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population .
PMID:535	NA	NA	NA	NA	This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers , mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer
PMID:536	NA	NA	NA	NA	Beta - catenin accumulation and mutation of the CTNNB1 gene in hepatoblastoma .
PMID:537	NA	NA	NA	NA	Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in children at an average age of 2 to 3 years .
PMID:538	NA	NA	NA	NA	Epidemiologic studies have shown an increased frequency of this tumor type in families affected by adenomatous polyposis coli .
PMID:539	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition to the epidemiologic data , molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis .
PMID:540	NA	NA	NA	NA	A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta - catenin , a transcription - activating protein with oncogenic potential .
PMID:541	NA	NA	NA	NA	In an ongoing immunohistochemical study of beta - catenin expression in sporadic cases of tumor types that are associated with adenomatous polyposis coli , we observed increased beta - catenin levels in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of three investigated hepatoblastomas .
PMID:542	NA	NA	NA	NA	Sequencing of exon 3 of the beta - catenin gene ( CTNNB1 ) revealed an activating mutation in one of the tumor samples .
PMID:543	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our data indicate for the first time that beta - catenin accumulation may play a role in the development of hepatoblastoma and that activating mutations of the beta - catenin gene may substitute biallelic APC inactivation in this tumor type .

PMID:545	NA	NA	NA	NA	Decrease in GTP cyclohydrolase I gene expression caused by inactivation of one allele in hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation .
PMID:546	NA	NA	NA	NA	Hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation ( HPD ; dopa - responsive dystonia , DRD ) have been recently found to be caused by a genetic defect in the GTP cyclohydrolase I ( GCH1 ) gene .
PMID:547	NA	NA	NA	NA	In this study , we quantified the mRNA level of GCH1 in phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) - stimulated mononuclear blood cells from one Japanese family that do not have a mutation in the coding region or splice junctions of the gene .
PMID:548	NA	NA	NA	NA	The results showed that the amounts of the GCH1 mRNA were decreased to about 40 % of the normal level in both patients and carriers .
PMID:549	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition , we found that the GCH1 mRNA was transcribed from only one allele , indicating that the other allele was in an inactive state .
PMID:550	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results suggest that some novel mutations should exist on one of the alleles in some unknown region of the GCH1 gene , and may decrease the GCH1 mRNA causing the HPD / DRD symptoms . .
PMID:551	NA	NA	NA	NA	Sulfate transport is not impaired in pendred syndrome thyrocytes .
PMID:552	NA	NA	NA	NA	Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness , characterized by dyshormonogenic goiter associated with sensory - neural deafness .
PMID:553	NA	NA	NA	NA	The gene responsible for the disease ( PDS ) has been cloned , but its function is as yet unknown and the connection between thyroid goiter and sensory - neural deafness remains an enigma .
PMID:554	NA	NA	NA	NA	PDS codes for a novel protein , pendrin , which is closely related to a number of sufate transporters .
PMID:555	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mechanisms by which abnormal sulfate transport could deleteriously affect iodide organification have been proposed .
PMID:556	NA	NA	NA	NA	We tested sulfate transport in thyrocytes obtained from Pendred syndrome patients and found that it was not defective .
PMID:557	NA	NA	NA	NA	This suggests that pendrin in fact may not be a sulfate transporter , and emphasizes the importance of functional studies on this novel protein . .
PMID:558	NA	NA	NA	NA	Small deletions in the type II collagen triple helix produce kniest dysplasia .
PMID:559	NA	NA	NA	NA	Kniest dysplasia is a moderately severe type II collagenopathy , characterized by short trunk and limbs , kyphoscoliosis , midface hypoplasia , severe myopia , and hearing loss .
PMID:560	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations in the gene that encodes type II collagen ( COL2A1 ) , the predominant protein of cartilage , have been identified in a number of individuals with Kniest dysplasia .
PMID:561	NA	NA	NA	NA	All but two of these previously described mutations cause in - frame deletions in type II collagen , either by small deletions in the gene or splice site alterations .
PMID:562	NA	NA	NA	NA	Furthermore , all but one of these mutations is located between exons 12 and 24 in the COL2A1 gene .
PMID:563	NA	NA	NA	NA	We used heteroduplex analysis to identify sequence anomalies in five individuals with Kniest dysplasia .
PMID:564	NA	NA	NA	NA	Sequencing of the index patients genomic DNA identified four new dominant mutations in COL2A1 that result in Kniest dysplasia a 21 - bp deletion in exon 16 , an 18 - bp deletion in exon 19 , and 4 - bp deletions in the splice donor sites of introns 14 and 20 .
PMID:565	NA	NA	NA	NA	A previously described 28 - bp deletion at the COL2A1 exon 12 - intron 12 junction , deleting the splice donor site , was identified in the fifth case .
PMID:566	NA	NA	NA	NA	The latter three mutations are predicted to result in exon skipping in the mRNA encoded from the mutant allele .
PMID:567	NA	NA	NA	NA	These data suggest that Kniest dysplasia results from shorter type II collagen monomers , and support the hypothesis that alteration of a specific COL2A1 domain , which may span from exons 12 to 24 , leads to the Kniest dysplasia phenotype . .
PMID:568	NA	NA	NA	NA	Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) gene .
PMID:569	NA	NA	NA	NA	Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose - 1 - phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) , which , in turn , is caused by mutations at the GALT gene .
PMID:570	NA	NA	NA	NA	The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide .
PMID:571	NA	NA	NA	NA	The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R , K285N , S135L , and N314D .
PMID:572	NA	NA	NA	NA	Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent .
PMID:573	NA	NA	NA	NA	Overall , it accounts for 60 - 70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations .
PMID:574	NA	NA	NA	NA	Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems .
PMID:575	NA	NA	NA	NA	Globally , K285N is rarer , but in many European populations it can be found on 25 - 40 % of mutant chromosomes .
PMID:576	NA	NA	NA	NA	It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype .
PMID:577	NA	NA	NA	NA	S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans .
PMID:578	NA	NA	NA	NA	In vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues .
PMID:579	NA	NA	NA	NA	Duarte 1 ( or Los Angeles ) and Duarte 2 ( or Duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , N314D , even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity .
PMID:580	NA	NA	NA	NA	N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles .
PMID:581	NA	NA	NA	NA	N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems .
PMID:582	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals .
PMID:583	NA	NA	NA	NA	It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities .
PMID:584	NA	NA	NA	NA	The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia .
PMID:585	NA	NA	NA	NA	The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . .
PMID:586	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations of the VHL gene in sporadic renal cell carcinoma : definition of a risk factor for VHL patients to develop an RCC .
PMID:587	NA	NA	NA	NA	To investigate the nature of somatic von Hippel - Lindau ( VHL ) mutations , we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene , using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and single - strand conformational polymorphism analysis ( SSCP ) of DNA .
PMID:588	NA	NA	NA	NA	We detected abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples .
PMID:589	NA	NA	NA	NA	After sequencing , we identified microdeletions in 58 % of cases , microinsertions in 17 % , nonsense mutations in 8 % , and missense mutations in 17 % .
PMID:590	NA	NA	NA	NA	Among these mutations , 50 % correspond to new mutations .
PMID:591	NA	NA	NA	NA	VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) subtype , as previously reported .
PMID:592	NA	NA	NA	NA	To compare somatic and germline mutations , we used the VHL database , which includes 507 mutations .
PMID:593	NA	NA	NA	NA	The study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78 % of somatic mutations vs only 37 % in germline mutations ( P < 0 . 001 ) .
PMID:594	NA	NA	NA	NA	We postulated that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC .
PMID:595	NA	NA	NA	NA	This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations .
PMID:596	NA	NA	NA	NA	We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families , based on the nature of mutations .
PMID:597	NA	NA	NA	NA	We observed RCC in at least one member of the VHL families in 77 % of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55 % in cases with missense mutations ( P < 0 . 05 ) .
PMID:598	NA	NA	NA	NA	Thus , mutations resulting in truncated proteins may lead to a higher risk of RCC in VHL patients

PMID:600	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cytotoxic T lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( CTLA - 4 , also known as CD152 ) has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of T cell activation .
PMID:601	NA	NA	NA	NA	Its membrane expression is highly regulated by endocytosis and trafficking through the secretory lysosome pathway .
PMID:602	NA	NA	NA	NA	Chediak - Higashi syndrome ( CHS ) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal trafficking regulator gene , LYST .
PMID:603	NA	NA	NA	NA	It results in defective membrane targeting of the proteins present in secretory lysosomes , and it is associated with a variety of features , including a lymphoproliferative syndrome with hemophagocytosis .
PMID:604	NA	NA	NA	NA	The murine equivalent of CHS , beige mice , present similar characteristics but do not develop the lymphoproliferative syndrome .
PMID:605	NA	NA	NA	NA	We show herein that CTLA - 4 is present in enlarged , abnormal vesicles in CHS T cells and is not properly expressed at the cell surface after T cell activation , whereas its surface expression is not impaired .
PMID:606	NA	NA	NA	NA	It is therefore proposed that the defective surface expression of CTLA - 4 by CHS T cells is involved in the generation of lymphoproliferative disease .
PMID:607	NA	NA	NA	NA	This observation may provide insight into the role of CTLA - 4 in humans . .

PMID:609	NA	NA	NA	NA	The Clinical European Network on Brain Dysmyelinating Disease .
PMID:610	NA	NA	NA	NA	Pelizaeus - Merzbacher Disease ( PMD ) is an X - linked developmental defect of myelination affecting the central nervous system and segregating with the proteolipoprotein ( PLP ) locus .
PMID:611	NA	NA	NA	NA	Investigating 82 strictly selected sporadic cases of PMD , we found PLP mutations in 77 % ; complete PLP - gene duplications were the most frequent abnormality ( 62 % ) , whereas point mutations in coding or splice - site regions of the gene were involved less frequently ( 38 % ) .
PMID:612	NA	NA	NA	NA	We analyzed the maternal status of 56 cases to determine the origin of both types of PLP mutation , since this is relevant to genetic counseling .
PMID:613	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the 22 point mutations , 68 % of mothers were heterozygous for the mutation , a value identical to the two - thirds of carrier mothers that would be expected if there were an equal mutation rate in male and female germ cells .
PMID:614	NA	NA	NA	NA	In sharp contrast , among the 34 duplicated cases , 91 % of mothers were carriers , a value significantly ( chi2 = 9 . 20 , P < . 01 ) in favor of a male bias , with an estimation of the male / female mutation frequency ( k ) of 9 .
PMID:615	NA	NA	NA	NA	3 3 .
PMID:616	NA	NA	NA	NA	Moreover , we observed the occurrence of de novo mutations between parental and grandparental generations in 17 three - generation families , which allowed a direct estimation of the k value ( k = 11 ) .
PMID:617	NA	NA	NA	NA	Again , a significant male mutation imbalance was observed only for the duplications .
PMID:618	NA	NA	NA	NA	Chromosome breakage in the Prader - Willi and Angelman syndromes involves recombination between large , transcribed repeats at proximal and distal breakpoints .
PMID:619	NA	NA	NA	NA	Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) and Angelman syndrome ( AS ) are distinct neurobehavioral disorders that most often arise from a 4 - Mb deletion of chromosome 15q11 - q13 during paternal or maternal gametogenesis , respectively .

PMID:621	NA	NA	NA	NA	67 - 1 / 10 , 000 births , these deletions represent a common structural chromosome change in the human genome .
PMID:622	NA	NA	NA	NA	To elucidate the mechanism underlying these events , we characterized the regions that contain two proximal breakpoint clusters and a distal cluster .
PMID:623	NA	NA	NA	NA	Novel DNA sequences potentially associated with the breakpoints were positionally cloned from YACs within or near these regions .
PMID:624	NA	NA	NA	NA	Analyses of rodent - human somatic - cell hybrids , YAC contigs , and FISH of normal or rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences ( the END repeats ) at or near the breakpoints .
PMID:625	NA	NA	NA	NA	The END - repeat units are derived from large genomic duplications of a novel gene ( HERC2 ) , many copies of which are transcriptionally active in germline tissues .
PMID:626	NA	NA	NA	NA	One of five PWS / AS patients analyzed to date has an identifiable , rearranged HERC2 transcript derived from the deletion event .
PMID:627	NA	NA	NA	NA	We postulate that the END repeats flanking 15q11 - q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting in deletion .
PMID:628	NA	NA	NA	NA	Furthermore , we propose that active transcription of these repeats in male and female germ cells may facilitate the homologous recombination process .
PMID:629	NA	NA	NA	NA	Linkage analysis in a large Brazilian family with van der Woude syndrome suggests the existence of a susceptibility locus for cleft palate at 17p11 . 2 - 11 . 1 .
PMID:630	NA	NA	NA	NA	van der Woude syndrome ( VWS ) , which has been mapped to 1q32 - 41 , is characterized by pits and / or sinuses of the lower lip , cleft lip / palate ( CL / P ) , cleft palate ( CP ) , bifid uvula , and hypodontia ( H ) .
PMID:631	NA	NA	NA	NA	The expression of VWS , which has incomplete penetrance , is highly variable .
PMID:632	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both the occurrence of CL / P and CP within the same genealogy and a recurrence risk < 40 % for CP among descendants with VWS have suggested that the development of clefts in this syndrome is influenced by modifying genes at other loci .
PMID:633	NA	NA	NA	NA	To test this hypothesis , we have conducted linkage analysis in a large Brazilian kindred with VWS , considering as affected the individuals with CP , regardless of whether it is associated with other clinical signs of VWS .
PMID:634	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our results suggest that a gene at 17p11 .

PMID:639	NA	NA	NA	NA	The gene for ataxia - telangiectasia , ATM , spans about 150 kb of genomic DNA .
PMID:640	NA	NA	NA	NA	ATM mutations are found along the entire gene , with no evidence of a mutational hot spot .
PMID:641	NA	NA	NA	NA	Using DNA as the starting material , we screened the ATM gene in 92 A - T patients , using an optimized single - strand conformation polymorphism ( SSCP ) technique that detected all previously known mutations in the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) segments being analyzed .
PMID:642	NA	NA	NA	NA	To expedite screening , we sequentially loaded the SSCP gels with three different sets of PCR products that were pretested to avoid overlapping patterns .
PMID:643	NA	NA	NA	NA	Many of the DNA changes we detected were intragenic polymorphisms .
PMID:644	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of an expected 177 unknown mutations , we detected approximately 70 % , mostly protein truncating mutations ( that would have been detectable by protein truncation testing if RNA starting material had been available ) .
PMID:645	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations have now been defined for every exon of the ATM gene .
PMID:646	NA	NA	NA	NA	Herein , we present 35 new mutations and 34 new intragenic polymorphisms or rare variants within the ATM gene .
PMID:647	NA	NA	NA	NA	This is the most comprehensive compilation of ATM polymorphisms assembled to date .

PMID:650	NA	NA	NA	NA	We report a novel mutation in the XK gene ( XK ) in a Japanese patient with McLeod syndrome .
PMID:651	NA	NA	NA	NA	A 50 - year - old man showed progressive muscular atrophy , choreic movement , elevated level of serum creatinine kinase , and acanthocytosis .
PMID:652	NA	NA	NA	NA	The expression level of all the Kell antigens in erythrocyte was decreased and molecular analysis revealed a single - base ( T ) deletion at the nucleotide position 1095 in XK .
PMID:653	NA	NA	NA	NA	This deletion caused a frameshift in translation , leading to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 408 .
PMID:654	NA	NA	NA	NA	We conclude this single - base deletion causes defective Kx protein , which is responsible for the McLeod phenotype in this patient . .

PMID:657	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here , it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50 , which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95 / nibrin .
PMID:658	NA	NA	NA	NA	Upon irradiation , BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus , which colocalize with hRad50 .
PMID:659	NA	NA	NA	NA	Formation of irradiation - induced foci positive for BRCA1 , hRad50 , hMre11 , or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC / 1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild - type BRCA1 .
PMID:660	NA	NA	NA	NA	Ectopic expression of wild - type , but not mutated , BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent , methyl methanesulfonate .
PMID:661	NA	NA	NA	NA	These data suggest that BRCA1 is important for the cellular responses to DNA damage that are mediated by the hRad50 - hMre11 - p95 complex . .

PMID:664	NA	NA	NA	NA	METHODOLOGY PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study ( MPKUCS ) .
PMID:665	NA	NA	NA	NA	A total of 84 different mutations were detected , and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals .
PMID:666	NA	NA	NA	NA	Based on previous knowledge about mutation - phenotype associations , 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity ( severe PKU , moderate PKU , mild PKU , and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [ MHP ] ) .
PMID:667	NA	NA	NA	NA	Then , 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications .
PMID:668	NA	NA	NA	NA	The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity .
PMID:669	NA	NA	NA	NA	These patients are considered functionally hemizygous .
PMID:670	NA	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level .
PMID:671	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cognitive performance ( IQ ) was also significantly related to genotype .
PMID:672	NA	NA	NA	NA	The IQ of PAH - deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96 , respectively , whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84 , respectively .
PMID:673	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of the patients with PKU , 92 % had been treated during childhood .
PMID:674	NA	NA	NA	NA	Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations .
PMID:675	NA	NA	NA	NA	Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group .
PMID:676	NA	NA	NA	NA	CONCLUSIONS The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances .
PMID:677	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU .
PMID:678	NA	NA	NA	NA	The significant relationship among genotype , biochemical phenotype , and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy . .
PMID:679	NA	NA	NA	NA	Spinal xanthomatosis : a variant of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis .
PMID:680	NA	NA	NA	NA	We describe seven Dutch patients from six families with a slowly progressive , mainly spinal cord syndrome that remained for many years the sole expression of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) .
PMID:681	NA	NA	NA	NA	MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities in the lateral and dorsal columns of the spinal cord .
PMID:682	NA	NA	NA	NA	Post - mortem examination of one of the patients showed extensive myelin loss in these columns .
PMID:683	NA	NA	NA	NA	An array of genotypes was found in these patients .
PMID:684	NA	NA	NA	NA	We conclude that spinal xanthomatosis is a clinical and radiological separate entity of CTX that should be included in the differential diagnosis of chronic myelopathy . .
PMID:685	NA	NA	NA	NA	A transgene insertion creating a heritable chromosome deletion mouse model of Prader - Willi and angelman syndromes .
PMID:686	NA	NA	NA	NA	Prader - Willi syndrome ( PWS ) and Angelman syndrome ( AS ) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11 - q13 .
PMID:687	NA	NA	NA	NA	The central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11 - q13 , with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features .
PMID:688	NA	NA	NA	NA	We report here the characterization of a transgene insertion ( Epstein - Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 2A , LMP2A ) into mouse chromosome 7C , which has resulted in mouse models for PWS and AS dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent .
PMID:689	NA	NA	NA	NA	Epigenotype ( allelic expression and DNA methylation ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene - induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the PWS / AS - homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci .
PMID:690	NA	NA	NA	NA	Because the intact chromosome 7 , opposite the deleted homolog , maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of PWS and AS mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of AS mice , homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism .
PMID:691	NA	NA	NA	NA	This heritable - deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms , phenotypic basis , and investigation of therapeutic approaches for PWS . .
PMID:692	NA	NA	NA	NA	Linkage analysis of 5 novel van der Woude syndrome kindreds to 1q32 - q41 markers further supports locus homogeneity of the disease trait .
PMID:693	NA	NA	NA	NA	van der Woude syndrome ( vWS , MIM 119300 ) is a rare autosomal dominant clefting condition with cardinal features of mucous cysts ( lower - lip pits ) and clefts to the lip and / or palate .
PMID:694	NA	NA	NA	NA	The vWS gene has been assigned to a locus in 1q32 - q41 by linkage analysis and physical mapping .
PMID:695	NA	NA	NA	NA	We have investigated 5 novel vWS families through probands attended for cleft lip and / or palate repair at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Hopital Trousseau , Paris , in order to tentatively refine the genetic map of the vWS region in 1q32 - q41 and possibly identify unlinked pedigrees .
PMID:696	NA	NA	NA	NA	Linkage analysis was carried out to 6 microsatellite markers ( D1S249 , D1S425 , D1S491 , D1S205 , D1S414 , D1S425 ) , yielding a maximum cumulative LOD score of Z = 3 .

PMID:702	NA	NA	NA	NA	The Atp7b protein is a copper - transporting ATPase expressed predominantly in the liver and to a lesser extent in most other tissues .
PMID:703	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations in the ATP7B gene lead to Wilson disease , a copper toxicity disorder characterized by dramatic build - up of intracellular hepatic copper with subsequent hepatic and neuro - logical abnormalities .
PMID:704	NA	NA	NA	NA	Using homologous recombination to disrupt the normal translation of ATP7B , we have generated a strain of mice that are homozygous mutants ( null ) for the Wilson disease gene .
PMID:705	NA	NA	NA	NA	The ATP7B null mice display a gradual accumulation of hepatic copper that increases to a level 60 - fold greater than normal by 5 months of age .
PMID:706	NA	NA	NA	NA	An increase in copper concentration was also observed in the kidney , brain , placenta and lactating mammary glands of homo - zygous mutants , although milk from the mutant glands was copper deficient .
PMID:707	NA	NA	NA	NA	Morphological abnormalities resembling cirrhosis developed in the majority of the livers from homozygous mutants older than 7 months of age .
PMID:708	NA	NA	NA	NA	Progeny of the homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities and growth retardation characteristic of copper deficiency .
PMID:709	NA	NA	NA	NA	Copper concentration in the livers of the newborn homozygous null mutants was decreased dramatically .

PMID:712	NA	NA	NA	NA	Segregation distortion has been reported to occur in a number of the trinucleotide repeat disorders .
PMID:713	NA	NA	NA	NA	On the basis of a sperm typing study performed in patients of Japanese descent with Machado - Joseph disease ( MJD ) , it was reported that disease alleles are preferentially transmitted during meiosis .
PMID:714	NA	NA	NA	NA	We performed a sperm typing study of five MJD patients of French descent and analysis of the pooled data shows a ratio of mutant to normal alleles of 379 436 ( 46 . 5 53 . 5 % ) , which does not support meiotic segregation distortion .
PMID:715	NA	NA	NA	NA	To confirm these results , sperm typing analysis was also performed using a polymorphic marker , D14S1050 , closely linked to the MJD1 gene .
PMID:716	NA	NA	NA	NA	Among 910 sperm analyzed , the allele linked to the disease chromosome was detected in 50 .

PMID:719	NA	NA	NA	NA	The difference in frequency of these two alleles is not significant ( P = 0 . 8423 ) .
PMID:720	NA	NA	NA	NA	Likelihood - based analysis of segregation distortion in the single sperm data using the SPERMSEG program also showed no support for segregation distortion at the gamete level in this patient population .
PMID:721	NA	NA	NA	NA	The previous report on the Japanese patients also suggested that disease allele stability may be influenced by a trans effect of an intragenic polymorphism ( 987 G / C ) in the wild - type allele .
PMID:722	NA	NA	NA	NA	All of the French patients were heterozygous for this polymorphism .
PMID:723	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , analysis of the variance in repeat number in sperm from the French MJD patients overlapped significantly with the variance in repeat number observed in the C / C homozygous Japanese patients .

PMID:725	NA	NA	NA	NA	The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis , and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , corneal dystrophy , congenital cataract , and foveal hypoplasia .
PMID:726	NA	NA	NA	NA	The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired - type DNA - binding domain .
PMID:727	NA	NA	NA	NA	The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA - binding subdomains , the N - terminal subdomain ( NTS ) and the C - terminal subdomain ( CTS ) , which bind respective consensus DNA sequences .
PMID:728	NA	NA	NA	NA	The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain .
PMID:729	NA	NA	NA	NA	The insertion , into the NTS , of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA - binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA - binding ability of the CTS .
PMID:730	NA	NA	NA	NA	Thus , exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes .
PMID:731	NA	NA	NA	NA	We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly , congenital cataract , Axenfeldt anomaly , and / or foveal hypoplasia , which , to our knowledge , is the first mutation identified in the splice - variant region .
PMID:732	NA	NA	NA	NA	A T - - > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val - - > Asp ( GTC - - > GAC ) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region .

PMID:741	NA	NA	NA	NA	No difference , in penetrance and expression , between the two mutations were found , whereas differences according to method of ascertainment were seen .
PMID:742	NA	NA	NA	NA	The overall findings were that disease started to occur at age 30 years and that by age 50 years 48 % of the mutation - carrying women had experienced breast and / or ovarian cancer .
PMID:743	NA	NA	NA	NA	More ovarian cancers than breast cancers were recorded .
PMID:744	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both penetrance and expression ( breast cancer vs . ovarian cancer ) were different from those in reports of the Ashkenazi founder mutations .

PMID:748	NA	NA	NA	NA	Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans ( DFSP ) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 and 22 , which fuse the collagen type Ialpha1 ( COLIA1 ) gene to the platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) B - chain ( PDGFB ) gene .
PMID:749	NA	NA	NA	NA	To characterize the functional and structural properties of the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion protein , we generated a stable NIH3T3 cell line that contained a tumor - derived chimeric gene resulting from a COIA1 intron 7 - PDGFB intron 1 fusion .
PMID:750	NA	NA	NA	NA	Expression of the fusion protein led to morphological transformation and increased growth rate of these cells .
PMID:751	NA	NA	NA	NA	The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed the transformed phenotype and reduced the growth rate of COLIA1 / PDGFB - expressing cells but had no effects on control cells .
PMID:752	NA	NA	NA	NA	The presence of dimeric COLIA1 / PDGFB precursors was demonstrated through PDGFB immunoprecipitations of metabolically labeled cells and also by PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed by immunoblotting with COLIA1 antibodies .
PMID:753	NA	NA	NA	NA	Pulse - chase studies demonstrated that the COLIA1 / PDGFB precursor was processed to an end product that was indistinguishable from wild - type PDGF - BB .

PMID:756	NA	NA	NA	NA	We conclude that the COLIA1 / PDGFB fusion associated with DFSP contributes to tumor development through ectopic production of PDGF - BB and the formation of an autocrine loop .
PMID:757	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our findings , thus , suggest that PDGF receptors could be a target for pharmacological treatment of DFSP and giant cell fibroblastoma , e . g . , through the use of PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors such as CGP57148B .
PMID:758	NA	NA	NA	NA	Identification of a common PEX1 mutation in Zellweger syndrome .
PMID:759	NA	NA	NA	NA	The Zellweger spectrum of disease , encompassing Zellweger syndrome and the progressively milder phenotypes of neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum disease , is due to a failure to form functional peroxisomes .
PMID:760	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cell fusion complementation studies demonstrated that these diseases are genetically heterogeneous , with two - thirds of all patients lying within a single complementation group , CG1 .
PMID:761	NA	NA	NA	NA	Molecular genetic and cell biology studies have shown that PEX1 is deficient in many CG1 patients .
PMID:762	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , previous studies have focused on mildly affected patients and there is still no report of two mutant PEX1 alleles in any Zellweger syndrome patient .
PMID:763	NA	NA	NA	NA	Furthermore , mutations in the PMP70 gene have also been identified in two Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1 , raising the possibility that CG1 patients may represent a mixture of PEX1 - deficient and PMP70 - deficient individuals .
PMID:764	NA	NA	NA	NA	To address the molecular basis of disease in Zellweger syndrome patients from CG1 , we examined all 24 PEX1 exons in four patients , including both patients that have mutations in PMP70 .
PMID:765	NA	NA	NA	NA	PEX1 mutations were detected in all four patients , including a 1 - bp insertion ( c . 2097insT ) in exon 13 that was present in three of the four patients .
PMID:766	NA	NA	NA	NA	Subsequent studies demonstrated that this mutation is present in one - half of all CG1 patients and correlates with the Zellweger syndrome phenotype .
PMID:767	NA	NA	NA	NA	As this mutation leads to a loss of protein function its frequency makes it the most common cause of Zellweger syndrome , helping to explain the high percentage of patients that belong to CG1 .

PMID:774	NA	NA	NA	NA	All missense mutations were located in exons 1 - 4 .
PMID:775	NA	NA	NA	NA	Most of the nonsense , frameshift and splice site mutations were found in exons 6 - 11 .
PMID:776	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutations that alter splice sites led to the synthesis of several types of mRNAs , a fraction of which represented the normally spliced product .
PMID:777	NA	NA	NA	NA	The presence of normally spliced transcripts was correlated with a milder phenotype .
PMID:778	NA	NA	NA	NA	When one such case was studied by Western blotting , reduced amounts of normal - size WASP were present .

PMID:786	NA	NA	NA	NA	A significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons .
PMID:787	NA	NA	NA	NA	On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells , we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene .
PMID:788	NA	NA	NA	NA	Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane .
PMID:789	NA	NA	NA	NA	We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice .
PMID:790	NA	NA	NA	NA	We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury .
PMID:791	NA	NA	NA	NA	To our knowledge , our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo .
PMID:792	NA	NA	NA	NA	Furthermore , these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations .

PMID:794	NA	NA	NA	NA	Loss of the ataxia - telangiectasia gene product causes oxidative damage in target organs .
PMID:795	NA	NA	NA	NA	Ataxia - telangiectasia ( A - T ) is characterized by a markedly increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation , increased incidence of cancer , and neurodegeneration , especially of the cerebellar Purkinje cells .
PMID:796	NA	NA	NA	NA	Ionizing radiation oxidizes macromolecules and causes tissue damage through the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) .
PMID:797	NA	NA	NA	NA	We therefore hypothesized that A - T is due to oxidative damage resulting from loss of function of the A - T gene product .
PMID:798	NA	NA	NA	NA	To assess this hypothesis , we employed an animal model of A - T , the mouse with a disrupted Atm gene .
PMID:799	NA	NA	NA	NA	We show that organs which develop pathologic changes in the Atm - deficient mice are targets of oxidative damage , and that cerebellar Purkinje cells are particularly affected .

PMID:803	NA	NA	NA	NA	The c862t ( R279W ) transition is the most common mutation in non - Finnish patients , but in these disorders it is usually combined with other DTDST mutations .
PMID:804	NA	NA	NA	NA	We had not seen a case of homozygosity for c862t ( R279W ) until we analysed DNA from a 36 year old male with tall - normal stature ( 180 cm ) who asked for genetic counselling for suspected multiple epiphyseal dysplasia .

PMID:808	NA	NA	NA	NA	He was found to be homozygous , and both healthy parents heterozygous , for the R279W mutation in DTDST , and his fibroblasts showed a sulphate incorporation defect typical of DTDST disorders .
PMID:809	NA	NA	NA	NA	Counselling was given for a recessive disorder , thereby considerably reducing the probability of affected offspring .
PMID:810	NA	NA	NA	NA	Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is more frequently caused by dominant mutations in the COMP ( EDM1 , McKusick 132400 ) and COL9A2 genes ( EDM2 , McKusick 600204 ) .

PMID:822	NA	NA	NA	NA	Clues from attenuated polyposis , missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region ( codons 1 , 250 - 1 , 450 ) indicate , however , that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function .
PMID:823	NA	NA	NA	NA	We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region ( codons 1 , 194 - 1 , 392 at most ) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas , in contrast to other FAP patients , whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region .

PMID:842	NA	NA	NA	NA	In 1994 , we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation ( which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels ) in 3011 unrelated white adults .
PMID:843	NA	NA	NA	NA	We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin - saturation values ( 45 percent or higher ) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation .
PMID:844	NA	NA	NA	NA	We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher .

PMID:874	NA	NA	NA	NA	Individuals with normal ERGs have mutations predominantly located 5 of the transcript initiation site of Dp260 .
PMID:875	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our results suggest that the most important determinant in the ERG b - wave phenotype is the mutation position , rather than muscle disease severity .
PMID:876	NA	NA	NA	NA	Forty - six per cent of patients with mutations 5 of the Dp260 transcript start site have abnormal ERGs , as opposed to 94 % with more distal mutations .
PMID:877	NA	NA	NA	NA	The human genotype - phenotype correlations are consistent with a role for Dp260 in normal retinal electrophysiology and may also reflect the expression of other C - terminal dystrophin isoforms and their contributions to retinal signal transmission . .
PMID:878	NA	NA	NA	NA	Cis and trans effects of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation in a cell culture model .
PMID:879	NA	NA	NA	NA	The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as a CTG expansion in the 3 - untranslated region ( 3 - UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) , but the mechanism ( s ) of pathogenesis remain unknown .
PMID:880	NA	NA	NA	NA	Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results .
PMID:881	NA	NA	NA	NA	Therefore , to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts .
PMID:882	NA	NA	NA	NA	By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3 - UTR , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation .
PMID:883	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3 - UTR , with as few as 57 CTGs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci .
PMID:884	NA	NA	NA	NA	We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( CTG ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects .
PMID:885	NA	NA	NA	NA	Furthermore , in contrast to the normal DMPK 3 - UTR mRNA , a mutant DMPK 3 - UTR mRNA with ( CUG ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts .
PMID:886	NA	NA	NA	NA	Genetic analysis and the Cre - loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3 - UTR transcript .
PMID:887	NA	NA	NA	NA	Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the DMPK 3 - UTR .
PMID:888	NA	NA	NA	NA	These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . .
PMID:889	NA	NA	NA	NA	Coats ' disease of the retina ( unilateral retinal telangiectasis ) caused by somatic mutation in the NDP gene : a role for norrin in retinal angiogenesis .
PMID:890	NA	NA	NA	NA	Coats disease is characterized by abnormal retinal vascular development ( so - called retinal telangiectasis ) which results in massive intraretinal and subretinal lipid accumulation ( exudative retinal detachment ) .
PMID:891	NA	NA	NA	NA	The classical form of Coats disease is almost invariably isolated , unilateral and seen in males .
PMID:892	NA	NA	NA	NA	A female with a unilateral variant of Coats disease gave birth to a son affected by Norrie disease .
PMID:893	NA	NA	NA	NA	Both carried a missense mutation within the NDP gene on chromosome Xp11 .
PMID:894	NA	NA	NA	NA	2 2 .
PMID:895	NA	NA	NA	NA	Subsequently analysis of the retinas of nine enucleated eyes from males with Coats disease demonstrated in one a somatic mutation in the NDP gene which was not present within non - retinal tissue .
PMID:896	NA	NA	NA	NA	We suggest that Coats telangiectasis is secondary to somatic mutation in the NDP gene which results in a deficiency of norrin ( the protein product of the NDP gene ) within the developing retina .
PMID:897	NA	NA	NA	NA	This supports recent observations that the protein is critical for normal retinal vasculogenesis .
PMID:898	NA	NA	NA	NA	Hereditary TP53 codon 292 and somatic P16INK4A codon 94 mutations in a Li - Fraumeni syndrome family .
PMID:899	NA	NA	NA	NA	Li - Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases .
PMID:900	NA	NA	NA	NA	Although hereditary TP53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers , it has been frequently reported in Li - Fraumeni syndrome .
PMID:901	NA	NA	NA	NA	On the other hand , hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A , which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53 , were observed in some types of cancer .

PMID:903	NA	NA	NA	NA	The propositus had a seminoma , his daughter a medulloblastoma , and one of his healthy cousins , a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation ( AAA - - > ATA ; Lys - - > Ile ) in the peripheral blood cells .
PMID:904	NA	NA	NA	NA	Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene .
PMID:905	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter , a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation ( GCG - - > GAG ; Ala - - > Glu ) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation .
PMID:906	NA	NA	NA	NA	P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li - Fraumeni syndrome .
PMID:907	NA	NA	NA	NA	No other gene alteration in TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A was observed .
PMID:908	NA	NA	NA	NA	Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene ( seminoma / medulloblastoma ) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis .
PMID:909	NA	NA	NA	NA	The gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A genes may be used as tumor markers in our family . .

PMID:912	NA	NA	NA	NA	Since the original report , we have diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism by newborn TSH screening in 9 additional children from the family .
PMID:913	NA	NA	NA	NA	We performed direct sequencing of the PCR products of each NIS ( sodium / iodide symporter ) gene exon with flanking introns amplified from genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood cells of the patients .
PMID:914	NA	NA	NA	NA	We identified a novel NIS gene mutation , G395R ( Gly395 - - > Arg ; GGA - - > AGA ) , in 10 patients examined in the present study .
PMID:915	NA	NA	NA	NA	All of the parents tested were heterozygous for the mutation , suggesting that the patients were homozygous .
PMID:916	NA	NA	NA	NA	The mutation was located in the 10th transmembrane helix .
PMID:917	NA	NA	NA	NA	Expression experiments by transfection of the mutant NIS complimentary DNA into COS - 7 cells showed no perchlorate - sensitive iodide uptake , confirming that the mutation is the direct cause of the iodide transport defect in these patients .
PMID:918	NA	NA	NA	NA	A patient who showed an intermediate saliva / serum technetium ratio ( 14 . 0 ; normal , > or = 20 ) and was considered to have a partial or less severe defect in the previous report ( IX - 24 ) did not have a NIS gene mutation .
PMID:919	NA	NA	NA	NA	It is now possible to use gene diagnostics of this unique NIS mutation to identify patients with congenital hypothyroidism due to an iodide transport defect in this family and to determine the carrier state of potential parents for genetic counseling and arranging rapid and early diagnosis of their infants .
PMID:920	NA	NA	NA	NA	Molecular analysis in familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus : early diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier .
PMID:921	NA	NA	NA	NA	Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait .
PMID:922	NA	NA	NA	NA	In the present study we have analyzed the AVP - neurophysin II ( AVP - NPII ) gene in a Spanish kindred .
PMID:923	NA	NA	NA	NA	Studies were performed on seven members ( four clinically affected ) of the family .
PMID:924	NA	NA	NA	NA	Patients were diagnosed at the Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon ( Madrid , Spain ) .
PMID:925	NA	NA	NA	NA	The entire coding region of the AVP - NPII gene of all family members was amplified by PCR and sequenced .
PMID:926	NA	NA	NA	NA	All affected individuals presented a missense mutation ( G1757 - - > A ) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the NPII domain .
PMID:927	NA	NA	NA	NA	The substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis .
PMID:928	NA	NA	NA	NA	Additionally , one of the asymptomatic relatives ( a girl 8 months old at the time of study ) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later .
PMID:929	NA	NA	NA	NA	The alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease , as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed FNDI .
PMID:930	NA	NA	NA	NA	Identification of the molecular defect underlying FNDI in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants . .

PMID:934	NA	NA	NA	NA	The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210 - aa protein , frataxin , which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in FRDA patients .
PMID:935	NA	NA	NA	NA	Frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene ( YFH1 ) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtDNA associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron .
PMID:936	NA	NA	NA	NA	Here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of FRDA patients .
PMID:937	NA	NA	NA	NA	Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial ATP production ( V ( max ) ) below the normal range in all 12 FRDA patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial V ( max ) and the number of GAA repeats in the smaller allele .
PMID:938	NA	NA	NA	NA	Our results show that FRDA is a nuclear - encoded mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation and give a rationale for treatments aimed to improve mitochondrial function in this condition . .
PMID:939	NA	NA	NA	NA	Identification of a novel R21X mutation in the liver - type arginase gene ( ARG1 ) in four Portuguese patients with argininemia .
PMID:940	NA	NA	NA	NA	Argininemia is a rare autossomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency in the cytosolic liver - type arginase enzyme ( L - arginine urea - hydrolase ; E . C . 3 . 5 . 3 . 1 ) .
PMID:941	NA	NA	NA	NA	In order to investigate the molecular basis for argininemia in four unrelated Portuguese patients ( two from northern Portugal and two from Madeira Island ) we performed a DNA sequence analysis of all the exons and exon / intron boundaries of the liver - type arginase gene ( ARG1 ) .

PMID:944	NA	NA	NA	NA	Mutation of the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ) results in truncation of mRNA expressed in leucocytes in a Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis .
PMID:945	NA	NA	NA	NA	OBJECTIVES A Japanese family with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) was investigated for a sequence alteration in the sterol 27 - hydroxylase gene ( CYP27 ) .
PMID:946	NA	NA	NA	NA	The expression of CYP27 has been mostly explored using cultured fibroblasts , prompting the examination of the transcripts from blood leucocytes as a simple and rapid technique .

PMID:951	NA	NA	NA	NA	The sequencing of the patients cDNA fragment disclosed a direct conjuction of exon 6 and exon 8 .
PMID:952	NA	NA	NA	NA	CONCLUSION The mutation at splice donor site and the truncation of mRNA were identical with those of a recently reported Italian patient , although different in symptomatology .
PMID:953	NA	NA	NA	NA	The application of blood leucocytes can be a simple technique on analysing a constructive abnormality of CYP27 mRNA . .
PMID:954	NA	NA	NA	NA	Clinical and molecular genetic analysis of 19 Wolfram syndrome kindreds demonstrating a wide spectrum of mutations in WFS1 .
PMID:955	NA	NA	NA	NA	Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile - onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy .
PMID:956	NA	NA	NA	NA	mtDNA deletions have been described , and a gene ( WFS1 ) recently has been identified , on chromosome 4p16 , encoding a predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein .

PMID:960	NA	NA	NA	NA	We identified 24 mutations in the WFS1 gene 8 nonsense mutations , 8 missense mutations , 3 in - frame deletions , 1 in - frame insertion , and 4 frameshift mutations .
PMID:961	NA	NA	NA	NA	Of these , 23 were novel mutations , and most occurred in exon 8 .
PMID:962	NA	NA	NA	NA	The majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations , and there was no common founder mutation .
PMID:963	NA	NA	NA	NA	The data were also analyzed for genotype - phenotype relationships .
PMID:964	NA	NA	NA	NA	Although some interesting cases were noted , consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear - cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity .
PMID:965	NA	NA	NA	NA	There were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters .
PMID:966	NA	NA	NA	NA	Hence , molecular screening for Wolfram syndrome in affected families and for Wolfram syndrome - carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons . .

PMID:986	NA	NA	NA	NA	A highly accurate , low cost test for BRCA1 mutations .
PMID:987	NA	NA	NA	NA	The hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is associated with a high frequency of BRCA1 mutations .
PMID:988	NA	NA	NA	NA	However , the widespread use of BRCA1 testing has been limited to date by three principal concerns the fear of loss of health and life insurance , the uncertain clinical value of a positive test result , and the current lack of an inexpensive and sensitive screening test for BRCA1 mutations .
PMID:989	NA	NA	NA	NA	We have developed an inexpensive system for gene mutational scanning , based on a combination of extensive multiplex PCR amplification and two dimensional electrophoresis .
PMID:990	NA	NA	NA	NA	The efficiency of this system , as a screening test for BRCA1 mutations , was evaluated in a panel of 60 samples from high risk women , 14 of which contained a previously identified mutation in BRCA1 .
PMID:991	NA	NA	NA	NA	All 14 mutations were identified , as well as an additional five that had previously escaped detection .
PMID:992	NA	NA	NA	NA	In addition to the 19 mutations , a total of 15 different polymorphic variants were scored , most of which were recurring .
PMID:993	NA	NA	NA	NA	All were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing .
